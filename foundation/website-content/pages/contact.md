# Get Involved

SIF is early-stage, but we're building in the open. Here's how you can engage with the work.

---

## Use the Tools

The fastest way to understand what we're building is to **use the production systems**:

### Reveal — Progressive Code Exploration
```bash
pip install reveal-cli
reveal --agent-help  # See what it can do
```

Try it on your codebase. If you see the value in structure-first exploration, you're seeing the core pattern behind all our work.

**Repository:** [github.com/scottsen/reveal](https://github.com/scottsen/reveal)

### Other Systems
- **Morphogen:** Deterministic computation framework → [github.com/scottsen/morphogen](https://github.com/scottsen/morphogen)
- **TiaCAD:** Declarative parametric CAD → [github.com/scottsen/tiacad](https://github.com/scottsen/tiacad)
- **GenesisGraph:** Cryptographic provenance → [github.com/scottsen/genesisgraph](https://github.com/scottsen/genesisgraph)

## For Researchers

**Interested in collaboration?**

We're exploring:
- Semantic memory and provenance systems
- Universal semantic intermediate representations (USIR)
- Multi-agent coordination substrates
- Progressive disclosure for human-AI interaction

If you're working on related problems and see potential for collaboration, reach out.

**Contact:** research@semanticinfrastructure.org

---

## For Engineers

**Want to contribute code?**

All four production systems are open source:
- Bug reports and feature requests welcome
- Pull requests reviewed thoughtfully
- Documentation improvements valued
- Test coverage expansion appreciated

We're a small operation right now, so patience on response times—but genuine contributions get genuine attention.

**Start here:** Pick a system, try it out, read the code, file an issue or PR.

---

## For Organizations

**Deploying semantic infrastructure?**

If your organization is:
- Building multi-agent systems that need provenance
- Conducting AI-assisted research requiring reproducibility
- Developing tools where transparency matters
- Exploring semantic representations for domain-specific work

We can advise on architecture, integration patterns, and best practices. This isn't consulting (we're not set up for that yet)—it's mutual learning.

**Contact:** partnerships@semanticinfrastructure.org

## For Potential Funders

**Interested in supporting the mission?**

**Current status (be advised):**
- SIF is **not yet a 501(c)(3)** (planned for 2025)
- **No formal donation mechanism** exists yet
- Scott is self-funded, working full-time on this
- We're building strategic documentation before fundraising

**When funding mechanisms are ready:**
- We'll announce via this website and GitHub
- Hybrid funding model (grants, enterprise support, philanthropy)
- Anti-capture protections (max 10% from any single source)
- Full transparency on governance and financial decisions

**Why talk to us now?**

If you're a foundation, philanthropist, or mission-aligned funder who wants to:
- Understand the vision and technical approach
- Advise on governance structure before it's formalized
- Be notified when funding mechanisms go live
- Explore early partnership or grant opportunities

**Contact:** funding@semanticinfrastructure.org

See our [funding strategy documentation](/funding) for detailed plans.

## For Mission-Aligned Individuals

**Believe in Timeline B?**

Right now, the best way to help is:

1. **Use and share the tools** — Adoption drives visibility
2. **Contribute to the codebase** — Code, docs, tests, examples
3. **Spread the ideas** — Talk about semantic infrastructure, provenance, transparency
4. **Stay informed** — Watch the GitHub repos, follow development

When formal support mechanisms exist (donations, memberships, volunteer roles), we'll announce them clearly.

---

## Stay Updated

**GitHub:** All strategic and technical documentation lives at:
- [Funding Strategy](/funding) — Foundation funding model
- [Research](/research) — Lab research and production systems

**Newsletter:** (Coming soon — when we have bandwidth to maintain one)

## Expectations & Transparency

**What to expect:**
- **Slow responses** — Small team (currently one person)
- **Honest conversations** — We won't oversell or overpromise
- **Long-term thinking** — This is decade-scale work
- **Open documentation** — Strategic plans published, not hidden

**What NOT to expect:**
- Immediate deployment partnerships (we're not ready)
- Formal advisory roles yet (governance in formation)
- Guaranteed funding timelines (depends on 501c3 approval)
- Marketing polish (we prioritize substance over presentation)

---

## The Invitation

**This is early-stage work.** We're building systems that work, documenting architecture openly, and inviting collaboration from those who believe semantic infrastructure matters.

If you think Timeline B is worth building toward, there's a role for you—whether that's using the tools, contributing code, advising on strategy, or supporting the mission when funding mechanisms exist.

**Let's build the Glass Box Future together.**

## FAQ

**Q: Is SIF accepting donations now?**
No. We don't have 501(c)(3) status or formal donation infrastructure yet. When we do, we'll announce it clearly.

**Q: Can I volunteer?**
We appreciate the offer. Right now, the best way to help is contributing to the open-source codebase. Formal volunteer roles will come when we have team structure to coordinate them.

**Q: Are you hiring?**
Not yet. Team formation depends on securing funding. When positions open, we'll post them on this site and GitHub.

**Q: How can I support the mission right now?**
Use the tools. Contribute code. Share the ideas. That's the most valuable support at this stage.

**Q: Who's on the team besides Scott?**
Right now, just Scott. The vision includes a founding team, but commitments haven't been secured yet. We're honest about current reality.

**Q: When will SIF be fully operational?**
Target: 501(c)(3) filed by mid-2025, initial funding secured by Q4 2025, core team assembled by 2026. But plans adapt to reality—we'll update transparently.

**Q: What if you fail?**
We might. 15% probability by our honest assessment. But the work matters, and someone needs to try. The systems we're building will be useful regardless—semantic infrastructure benefits the ecosystem even if SIF doesn't achieve Bell Labs-tier success.
