# SIF Funding Model: Hybrid Foundation Approach

**Last Updated:** December 2025  
**Status:** Strategic Framework

---

## Executive Summary

The Semantic Infrastructure Foundation (SIF) follows a **hybrid foundation model** drawing from the best practices of Wikimedia Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, and Linux Foundation—while avoiding their pitfalls.

**Core Funding Strategy:**
1. **Philanthropic mega-grants** (Years 1-3 bootstrap)
2. **Strategic membership program** (Corporate partnerships without capture)
3. **Diversified donation campaigns** (Individual + institutional)
4. **Government research contracts** (Aligned R&D funding)
5. **Endowment building** (Long-term sustainability)

**Why Hybrid?**
- No single revenue stream can capture mission
- Diversification provides resilience
- Combines scale (memberships) with mission alignment (grants)
- Enables both immediate execution and long-term stability

## Foundation Models: Learning from Leaders

### Wikimedia Foundation (Broad-Base Individual Giving)

**Model:**
- Aggressive fundraising campaigns to millions of Wikipedia users
- $180M+ annual revenue, primarily from small donations ($15-50 average)
- Strong brand association = high donor trust

**What SIF Can Learn:**
✅ Transparent financial reporting builds trust  
✅ Clear mission story resonates with individual donors  
✅ Recurring donor programs provide stable baseline

**What to Avoid:**
❌ Banner fatigue from aggressive campaigns  
❌ Over-reliance on one revenue channel

---

### Mozilla Foundation (Corporate Partnerships + Product Revenue)

**Model:**
- ~$500M/year revenue (mostly Google search deal)
- Corporate partnerships for browser default search
- Mission-driven product (Firefox) generates revenue

**What SIF Can Learn:**
✅ Strategic partnerships can fund ambitious work  
✅ Products proving technical vision can attract funding

**What to Avoid:**
❌ Over-dependence on one partner (Google = 80%+ revenue)  
❌ Misalignment when partner incentives shift

---

### Linux Foundation (Membership Model)

**Model:**
- Platinum ($500K), Gold ($100K), Silver ($20K) membership tiers
- Corporate members fund shared infrastructure work
- Neutral governance prevents single-company capture

**What SIF Can Learn:**
✅ Membership tiers align corporate interests with public good  
✅ Clear governance prevents capture  
✅ Shared infrastructure = compelling value prop

**What to Avoid:**
❌ Risk of becoming corporate consortium vs. public foundation  
❌ Perception of "pay-to-play" in technical decisions

---

## SIF's Hybrid Approach

### Anti-Capture Financial Architecture

**Primary Rule:** No single entity can provide >10% of annual budget

| Source Type | Max % Budget | Rationale |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Single corporate member | 10% | Prevent undue influence |
| All corporate members | 30% | Limit collective influence |
| Single philanthropic grant | 10% | Prevent donor capture |
| Government contracts | 30% | Balance public funding |
| Individual donations | No limit | Grassroots support strengthens mission |

### Revenue Projections (5-Year Trajectory)

| Year | Grants | Memberships | Individual | Gov Contracts | Total | Staff |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|---------------|-------|-------|
| 1 | $1.5M | $200K | $50K | $250K | **$2M** | 3-4 |
| 2 | $3M | $800K | $200K | $500K | **$4.5M** | 6-8 |
| 3 | $4M | $2M | $500K | $1M | **$7.5M** | 10-12 |
| 4 | $5M | $4M | $1M | $2M | **$12M** | 15-18 |
| 5 | $6M | $7M | $2M | $3M | **$18M** | 20-25 |

**Year 10 Target:** $25M annual budget with $50M endowment

---

## Budget Allocation Philosophy

### Research-First Spending (70/20/10 Rule)

- **70% Research & Development** - Building semantic infrastructure
- **20% Operations & Infrastructure** - Systems that support the work
- **10% Fundraising & Administration** - Sustainable growth

**Why Research-First?**
- Mission delivery is the strategy
- Working systems attract funding (Reveal proves this: 2K downloads/month)
- Technical credibility enables partnerships

---

## Transparency Commitments

### Public Financial Reporting

**Quarterly:**
- Revenue by source category (anonymized)
- Spending by program area
- Reserve levels

**Annual:**
- Full audited financials
- Complete donor list (with permission)
- Impact metrics and technical deliverables

**Continuous:**
- All research output (code, papers, systems) public by default
- Session provenance (TIA system) shows decision-making process
- Glass Box principle applies to operations, not just technology

---

## Genesis Tier: First 100 Believers

**Special Recognition for Early Supporters**

The first 100 individuals who support SIF (any amount ≥$100) during formation (2025-2026) receive:

- **Permanent recognition** in SIF's founding documentation
- **Genesis Supporter badge** in community spaces
- **Annual founder's briefing** - Direct updates from leadership
- **Historical provenance** - Named in the origin story of semantic infrastructure

**Why Genesis Tier?**
Early believers take real risk on unproven vision. This recognizes that courage.

**Current Status:** 501(c)(3) not yet filed, no tax deduction available  
**Honest Reality:** You're supporting vision and working systems, not established institution

---

## Current Reality (December 2025)

**What Exists:**
✅ 4 production systems proving technical vision  
✅ Clear architectural roadmap  
✅ Transparent development process (1,400+ documented sessions)  
✅ This website and strategic framework

**What Doesn't Exist Yet:**
❌ 501(c)(3) status  
❌ Formal board or governance  
❌ Any funding beyond founder's time  
❌ Team (just Scott)

**The Ask:**
This is early-stage, high-risk foundation building. If you believe semantic infrastructure matters for Timeline B, now is when support makes the biggest difference.

---

## Why Fund SIF?

### The Timeline B Argument

Without semantic infrastructure, AI systems will remain epistemically brittle black boxes. With it, we can build transparent, accountable, verifiable AI systems.

**SIF is building the substrate that makes Timeline B possible.**

### The Working Systems Argument

This isn't vaporware:
- **Reveal** (2K downloads/month) proves progressive disclosure works
- **Morphogen** (1,600+ tests) proves deterministic computation scales
- **GenesisGraph** proves cryptographic provenance is viable
- **TIA** (60 projects, 14K+ files) proves semantic OS concepts work

**Funding SIF accelerates proven technical work, not speculative research.**

### The Glass Box Argument

SIF practices what it preaches:
- All research public by default
- Session provenance shows decision-making
- Financial transparency (when funding exists)
- Honest about current state

**You're funding an organization that can't hide behind opacity.**

## Questions?

**"Why should I trust SIF with funding?"**  
You shouldn't—yet. Trust working systems (Reveal, Morphogen), transparent process (TIA sessions), and honest communication about current state. Funding accelerates proven work.

**"What's the biggest risk?"**  
That semantic infrastructure isn't actually needed and Timeline A is fine. If you believe that, don't fund SIF.

**"When will 501(c)(3) be filed?"**  
Target Q1 2026. Waiting until governance model and initial supporters are clear to file correctly the first time.

**"Can I contribute technically instead of financially?"**  
Yes! Systems need contributors, especially expertise in cryptography, type systems, semantic web, and provenance.

**"Is SIF looking for board members?"**  
Not yet. Will recruit founding board when 501(c)(3) filing is imminent.

*Building Timeline B requires resources. If you believe semantic infrastructure matters, your support makes this possible.*
