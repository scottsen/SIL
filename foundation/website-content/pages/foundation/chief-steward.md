# Chief Steward of SIF

**About SIF:** The Semantic Infrastructure Foundation builds open semantic infrastructure for trustworthy AI—systems that show their reasoning, preserve provenance, and ground outputs in verifiable computation. We're working toward the Bell Labs model: long-term fundamental research focused on infrastructure that enables entire industries. [Learn more about SIF](/about)

## Role Overview

The Chief Steward serves as the guardian of SIF's mission, culture, and long-term institutional integrity. This is a governance role, not an operational role.

---

## Primary Responsibilities

### Mission Protection
- Guards the core mission: ensuring semantic infrastructure remains open, public, and anti-captured
- Constitutional veto power on decisions that compromise mission integrity
- Protects against mission drift over institutional lifetime (50+ year horizon)

### Governance & Oversight
- Serves as board chair of SIF
- Provides fiduciary oversight of foundation operations
- Hires and oversees Executive Director
- Ensures governance best practices

### Institutional Memory
- Maintains continuity beyond any single founder or operator
- Ensures institutional knowledge preservation
- Plans stewardship succession (appoints next Chief Steward)

### Hiring Oversight
- Final review on critical hires (Director of Engineering, Chief Scientist)
- Ensures cultural fit and mission alignment
- Guards against capture through hiring

### Anti-Capture Mechanisms
- Enforces funding diversity rules (no single funder >25% of budget)
- Maintains mission lock in bylaws and governance documents
- Prevents commercial or political capture of public infrastructure

---

## What This Role Is NOT

- **Not day-to-day operations** - That's the Executive Director's responsibility
- **Not technical decisions** - That's the Chief Architect's domain
- **Not fundraising execution** - ED handles, Steward advises
- **Not engineering management** - Director of Engineering handles

---

## Time Commitment

- **Year 1:** 10-15 hours/month (board meetings, governance setup, critical hiring)
- **Year 2-3:** 15-20 hours/month (strategic planning, board meetings)
- **Year 5+:** 20 hours/month (mature institution, more stakeholders)
- **Spikes:** Hiring cycles, major funding rounds, crisis management

---

## Compensation

Board position (unpaid, standard for nonprofit governance). High influence and legacy impact.

---

## Historical Precedent

The Chief Steward role is modeled after **Mervin Kelly** at Bell Labs - the institutional steward who protected the culture and mission while technical geniuses like Claude Shannon did the research.

**The pattern:** Steward protects institution, genius does the work.

---

## Required Skills

### Truth Without Casualty
Engineering culture often produces brutal honesty that causes social damage. The Chief Steward must deliver hard truths without destroying relationships - critical for board dynamics, hiring feedback, and founder accountability.

### Institutional Literacy
Most engineers excel at building but struggle with institutions. The Chief Steward must understand organizational design, nonprofit governance, and long-term stewardship - avoiding common startup failure modes.

### Anti-Ego
Nonprofit stewardship requires ego suppression (mission over self). The Chief Steward must champion others, not self-promote - critical for preventing capture and protecting mission integrity.

---

## Success Metrics

- **Year 1:** Foundation formed, governance structures established, first critical hires made with steward oversight
- **Year 3:** Mission protected through growth, no capture incidents, healthy culture maintained
- **Year 5:** Institution sustainable and independent of any single person, steward succession planned
- **Year 10+:** SIF outlives founders, mission intact, next generation of stewards prepared

---

## The Steward's Core Question

*"Is this decision aligned with the 50-year mission, or are we optimizing for short-term convenience?"*

The Chief Steward is the person who asks this question when everyone else is moving fast and breaking things.
