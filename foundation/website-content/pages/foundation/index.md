# Foundation Governance

**The challenge:** Most research organizations optimize for 3-5 years. The infrastructure we need takes 30+ years to build. How do we create institutions that outlive their founders while protecting mission integrity?

---

## The Governance Philosophy

SIF is being designed for a **50-year horizon**, not a 5-year sprint.

Our governance model is inspired by institutions that survived generations: Bell Labs (gave us Unix, C, the transistor), Xerox PARC (GUI, Ethernet, object-oriented programming), and foundations like Mozilla and Wikimedia that protect public infrastructure.

**Core principles:**

### Mission Lock
The mission—building open semantic infrastructure—is locked in governing documents. No single person, funder, or board can change it. Semantic infrastructure must remain public, open, and anti-captured.

### Distributed Authority
Technical decisions live with research leads. Operations live with the Executive Director. Governance lives with the Chief Steward. No concentration of power.

### Anti-Capture Mechanisms
- No single funder can provide >25% of operating budget
- Board majority independent of any commercial interest
- All research published under permissive open-source licenses
- Standards developed in the open with community input

### Stewardship Over Ownership
Nonprofit structure means no one "owns" SIF. We're stewards building public infrastructure for future generations.

## The Founding Model

SIF requires three complementary forces (not 2, not 1):

### Chief Architect (Technical Vision)
Defines the semantic substrate, USIR architecture, and research direction. Stays in lane: Architecture and research, not operations or governance.

### Chief Steward (Mission Guardian)
Guards mission, protects institutional integrity, chairs the board. The immune system—detects bad culture or architecture before it metastasizes. Modeled after Mervin Kelly at Bell Labs: the steward who protected the culture while geniuses like Claude Shannon did the research.

### Executive Director (Operational Leadership)
Runs foundation operations, executes fundraising, manages staff. Builds the institutional machine that lets research happen. Translates vision into budget, architecture into organization.

**The dynamic:** Architect picks the target → Director builds the institution → Steward keeps mission intact. Organizations that survive 30 years, not burn out in 3.

## Current Status: Honest Assessment

**What exists today:**
- Founding architect (Scott Senkeresty) with 4 production systems proving the vision
- Clear governance model documented
- Anti-capture mechanisms designed
- Strategic roadmap toward 501(c)(3) formation

**What doesn't exist yet:**
- Filed 501(c)(3) entity (SIF is planned, not operational)
- Committed Chief Steward or Executive Director
- Board beyond founding architect
- Operating budget or secured funding

**Why publish before we have it all?**

Because transparency matters. We're documenting how to build institutions that last, in the open, before they exist. If the governance model is sound, it should survive scrutiny before implementation.

---

## Why This Model?

Most technical nonprofits fail within 10 years. Common failure modes:
- **Founder capture:** Organization can't function without founder
- **Funder capture:** Single major funder dictates direction
- **Mission drift:** Success changes the mission ("this is where the money is")
- **Execution failure:** Great vision, no operational infrastructure

SIF's governance is designed to prevent all four:
- **Stewardship prevents founder capture** (institutional continuity beyond any single person)
- **Funding diversity prevents funder capture** (25% cap on any single source)
- **Mission lock prevents drift** (cannot be changed without dissolving the foundation)
- **ED role prevents execution failure** (professional operations from day one)

## Governance Timeline

### Year 1
- File 501(c)(3)
- Assemble founding board (3-5 directors)
- Establish bylaws with mission lock and anti-capture mechanisms
- Hire Executive Director
- Appoint Chief Steward

### Year 3
- 5-7 member board (majority independent)
- Quarterly governance reviews
- Anti-capture mechanisms tested under growth
- Steward succession planning begins

### Year 5+
- Self-sustaining governance (survives any single person leaving)
- Next generation of stewards identified
- Institution operating as designed

## The 50-Year Question

SIF exists to ask: *What infrastructure will AI systems need in 2075?*

The answer: **Semantic infrastructure that preserves provenance, grounds outputs in verifiable computation, and keeps reasoning transparent.**

That infrastructure won't be built in 5 years. It requires patient capital, long-term commitment, and governance that survives beyond any single founder.

This is what we're building. Not fast, but right.
