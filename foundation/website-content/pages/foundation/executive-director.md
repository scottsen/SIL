# Executive Director of SIF

**About SIF:** The Semantic Infrastructure Foundation builds open semantic infrastructure for trustworthy AI—systems that show their reasoning, preserve provenance, and ground outputs in verifiable computation. We're working toward the Bell Labs model: long-term fundamental research focused on infrastructure that enables entire industries. [Learn more about SIF](/about)

---

## Role Overview

The Executive Director runs SIF's day-to-day operations, executes fundraising strategy, manages staff, and builds the institutional infrastructure. This is the operational leadership role.

---

## Primary Responsibilities

### Fundraising & Revenue
- Execute fundraising strategy (philanthropic grants, corporate partnerships, government grants)
- Manage funder relationships
- Prepare grant applications and funding proposals
- Build diversified revenue streams
- Year 1 target: $2-5M | Year 3 target: $8-15M | Year 5+: $25-50M sustainable

### Foundation Operations
- Run nonprofit day-to-day (legal, finance, compliance, contracts)
- Manage operating budget and financial reporting
- Ensure 501(c)(3) compliance
- Set up and maintain operational infrastructure (banking, accounting, payroll, insurance)
- Board liaison (execute board decisions, provide status updates)

### Staff Management & Hiring
- Hire and manage non-technical staff (operations coordinator, grant writer, communications, HR)
- Support technical hiring (Director of Engineering owns process, ED closes candidates)
- Build org structure as foundation scales
- Manage team growth from 1 person → 5 → 15 → 30+

### Partnerships & External Relations
- Build academic partnerships
- Establish corporate relationships (sponsors, collaborators)
- Government relations (for grant opportunities)
- Represent SIF publicly when appropriate

---

## What This Role Is NOT

- **Not technical decisions** - That's the Chief Architect's domain (technical vision and architecture)
- **Not governance** - That's the Chief Steward's domain (mission protection)
- **Not engineering management** - Director of Engineering manages engineers, ED hires the DoE
- **Not research direction** - Chief Scientist sets research agenda (hire in Year 2)

---

## Time Commitment

- **Month 1-3:** Full-time, 60+ hours/week (foundation formation sprint)
- **Month 4-12:** Full-time, 50-60 hours/week (fundraising, hiring, operations setup)
- **Year 2-3:** Full-time, 40-50 hours/week (scaling operations)
- **Year 5+:** Full-time, 40 hours/week (sustainable mature institution)

---

## Compensation

Competitive nonprofit executive compensation benchmarks:
- **Year 1:** $140-180K (based on $2-5M budget secured)
- **Year 3:** $200-250K (based on $8-15M scale funding)
- **Year 5:** $280K+ (based on $25-50M sustainable budget)
- **Benefits:** Health insurance, retirement match, standard nonprofit package

No equity (nonprofit structure), but competitive nonprofit compensation.

---

## Day-to-Day (What You Actually Do)

### Month 1-3 (Foundation Formation)
- File 501(c)(3) paperwork (coordinate with attorney, founders, board)
- Set up foundation operations (banking, accounting, payroll, insurance)
- Prepare major funder pitch materials (coordinate with Chief Architect on tech demo)
- Begin board assembly (recruit 2-3 additional directors)

### Month 4-6 (Fundraising Sprint)
- Execute primary fundraising campaign (travel, present, negotiate)
- Explore backup funding options
- Set up grant infrastructure
- Hire first staff (operations coordinator, possibly grant writer)

### Month 6-12 (Team Building)
- Manage Director of Engineering hiring (Architect interviews, you close)
- Oversee first engineer hiring (DoE owns process, you support)
- Establish operational rhythms (board meetings, financial reporting, planning cycles)
- Begin Year 2 fundraising (scale funding $8-15M target)

### Year 2-3 (Scale Operations)
- Manage growing staff (5-10 people reporting to ED by Year 2)
- Execute scale funding round (corporate sponsors, major grants)
- Establish endowment strategy (Year 5 target: 50% endowment funding)
- Hire Chief Scientist (Architect identifies candidates, you close)
- Build partnerships (academic, corporate, government)

### Year 5+ (Mature Institution)
- Steady-state operations (30-40 person organization)
- Diversified funding (grants, memberships, endowment, services)
- Exit planning (hire successor, transition stewardship)

---

- ✅ Successor identified (exit planning)

## Required Skills

### "Semantic Extraction" Thinking
Experience structuring unstructured complexity. The parallel to SIF's mission: extracting meaning from chaos, building systems that make complexity manageable and inspectable.

### Crisis Leadership
The "Adult in the Room" - stabilizes without panicking. Critical for navigating fundraising challenges, organizational growing pains, and inevitable institutional stress.

### Marketplace of Meaning
Understanding how to map fuzzy intent (what funders/users want) to structured capability (what the organization can deliver). Experience building systems where intent meets execution.

## The Lifeboat (Exit Options)

### If Funding Fails (12 Months, No Money)
- **Option 1:** Founder continues solo (research doesn't die, just doesn't scale)
- **Option 2:** Pivot to consulting/services (bootstrap research via revenue)
- **Option 3:** Graceful wind-down (archive research, preserve dignity)
- **No one loses money** (nonprofit = no investment risk)

### If Scaling Fails (Year 3, Survival Mode)
- **Option 1:** Right-size to sustainable (6-8 engineers on grants)
- **Option 2:** Merge with academic institution (become university research lab)
- **Option 3:** Sunset with impact (publish all research, find homes for team)

### If It Works (Year 5, Mission Accomplished)
- **Option 1:** Stay for long haul (10+ years, build to maturity)
- **Option 2:** Hire successor ED (Year 5-7, train replacement, exit gracefully)
- **Option 3:** Transition to board role (advisory, not operational)

## Historical Precedent

While the Chief Steward role mirrors Mervin Kelly (institutional guardian), the Executive Director is the **operational implementer** - building the infrastructure that allows the technical vision to become reality.

**The pattern:** ED builds the machine, Architect does the research, Steward protects the mission.

---

## The ED's Core Question

*"Can we actually execute this? What resources do we need, and how do we get them?"*

The Executive Director translates vision into operations, mission into budget, architecture into organization.
