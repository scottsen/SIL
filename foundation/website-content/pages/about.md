# About the Semantic Infrastructure Foundation

## The Problem We're Solving

AI systems today are **epistemically brittle**. They generate plausible outputs without grounding in verifiable reality. When they fail, no one can explain why. When they succeed, we can't reproduce the result.

This isn't a compute problem or a scale problem. It's an **infrastructure problem**.

We're building the systems that aren't black boxes—we're missing the **semantic substrate** that would let AI systems:
- Represent knowledge with verifiable provenance
- Compose across domains without hallucination
- Show their reasoning in auditable chains
- Ground outputs in reproducible computation

Without this foundation, we're building increasingly powerful systems on increasingly unstable ground.

## What SIF Does

The Semantic Infrastructure Foundation develops **open semantic infrastructure** for trustworthy AI:

### Semantic Memory
Systems for provenance tracking and verification. Every result carries cryptographic proof of its computational history. You can ask "where did this come from?" and get a complete audit trail.

### Universal Semantic Intermediate Representation (USIR)
A common language for cross-domain knowledge. CAD models, scientific simulations, legal reasoning—all expressible in a shared semantic framework that preserves meaning and enables composition.

### Deterministic Computation
Engines that eliminate hidden state. Same inputs → same outputs, every time. Reproducible, verifiable, debuggable.

### Progressive Disclosure Tools
Human-AI interfaces that scale from structure to detail. Show me the outline, then the specifics I need—don't drown me in tokens or hide everything behind a black box.

### Open Standards
No single entity controls the semantic layer. We build in the open, publish our work, and advocate for adoption across the ecosystem.

## The Bell Labs Inspiration

SIF aspires to the **Bell Labs model**: long-term fundamental research protected from quarterly pressures, focused on infrastructure that enables entire industries.

Bell Labs gave us Unix, C, information theory, the transistor—foundational work that took decades and required patient capital. We need something similar for semantic infrastructure.

## Current Status: Honest Assessment

**What exists today:**
- **Scott Senkeresty** (founder, Chief Architect) — solo researcher with decade-long commitment
- **4 production systems** proving the vision (Reveal, Morphogen, TiaCAD, GenesisGraph)
- **Extensive strategic documentation** (governance, funding strategy, technical architecture)
- **Clear roadmap** toward Semantic OS and Agent Ether

**What doesn't exist yet:**
- Filed 501(c)(3) entity (SIF is planned, not operational)
- Funding ($0 revenue, Scott self-funded)
- Team beyond founder (no engineers, advisors identified but not committed)
- Lab space or operational foundation

**Why publish now?**

Because the work matters and transparency matters more. We're building systems that work, documenting architecture in public, and inviting collaboration from those who believe this problem is worth solving.

The vision is ambitious. The current reality is small. But the trajectory is clear, and the need is urgent.

## Who Is Scott Senkeresty?

**Founder & Board Chair**

Scott Senkeresty is a systems architect and infrastructure builder with over 40 years of experience making complex systems inspectable, accessible, and safe. He founded the Semantic Infrastructure Foundation to ensure that semantic infrastructure—the substrate for reasoning, meaning, and provenance in intelligent systems—remains open, inspectable, and accessible as a public good.

### Education & Background

**Education:** Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science, California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

**Career:** Four decades building infrastructure that empowers others—from distributed systems at Microsoft (1997-2010) to business intelligence consulting to founding SIL in 2025.

### Professional Experience

**Semantic Infrastructure Lab | Founder & Chief Architect (2025-Present)**

Founded SIL to build open semantic infrastructure for distributed intelligence. Led development of production systems including Reveal (semantic code exploration, published to PyPI), Morphogen (multi-domain simulation engine), GenesisGraph (provenance infrastructure), and TIA (transparent intelligent agent system with 14,549 files indexed, 1,900+ sessions).

Built working infrastructure demonstrating that explicit semantics, inspectable reasoning, and deterministic collaboration are practical necessities for reliable intelligent systems.

**Consulting & Startup Endeavors (2010-2025)**

Founded and operated consulting practice and startup initiatives, including Tiny Lizard (business intelligence consulting firm). Advised dozens of organizations on data transformation, actionable analytics, and decision support systems.

Developed "Crushing The Nouns" methodology—transforming static information into actionable decisions. Published 50+ educational articles on business intelligence, data modeling, and system design.

**Microsoft Corporation | Software Development Engineer (1997-2010)**

Worked across distributed systems infrastructure, security, and platform engineering for 13 years:

- **Peer-to-Peer Infrastructure Team (2001-2008):** Developed APIs for PNRP (Peer Name Resolution Protocol)—serverless distributed name resolution with cryptographic identity. This work predated Bitcoin; team built distributed cryptographic identity infrastructure (2001-2003) before blockchain era.

- **Anti-Malware/Security Teams:** Designed and built malware analysis tools enabling researchers to inspect dangerous code without execution. Created safe inspection frameworks for complex threat environments.

- **Office Division (1997-2000):** Built testing and validation tools for Office installation and setup systems.

### Early Achievement

**Published Author (Age 13):** "Colorful Sprites," *Compute's Gazette* (December 1984)—technical article explaining multi-color sprite techniques for Commodore 64, demonstrating early commitment to making complex concepts accessible.

### Philosophy

**Infrastructure as Public Good:** Believes fundamental infrastructure—like semantic substrate for intelligent systems—should be open, inspectable, and accessible rather than proprietary black boxes controlled by a few entities.

**Safety Through Transparency:** Demonstrated across 40+ years that complex or dangerous systems become safe when structure is visible and inspectable. Applied this principle from malware analysis tools to semantic infrastructure.

**Empowerment Over Heroism:** Builds tools and infrastructure that make others capable rather than creating dependency. Consistent pattern from Microsoft API wrappers to business intelligence consulting to semantic infrastructure.

**Evidence Over Vision:** Ships working systems and measured results before making claims. SIL has production tools (Reveal on PyPI, Morphogen with 900+ tests) demonstrating viability of approach.

## The Vision: 10-Year Horizon

**Year 1-2:** Establish foundation, secure initial funding, form core team
**Year 3-5:** Deploy semantic infrastructure in research institutions, build ecosystem
**Year 5-10:** Semantic OS becomes standard layer, Timeline B momentum builds

**Success metrics:**
- Major AI labs adopt USIR as common IR layer
- Regulators mandate provenance for high-stakes decisions
- Scientific replication rates improve 20%+
- Multi-agent systems run critical infrastructure reliably

**Honest probability:**
- 20% chance: Bell Labs-tier success (transform the ecosystem)
- 65% chance: Meaningful impact (advance the state of art, influence standards)
- 15% chance: Fail to achieve critical mass

We think those odds justify the effort.

## Governance & Funding

**Governance model:** Inspired by Wikimedia Foundation, Mozilla Foundation, and Linux Foundation—balance between mission focus and operational pragmatism.

**Funding strategy:** Hybrid model avoiding capture. Max 10% from any single source. Revenue from grants, enterprise support contracts, and philanthropic funding.

**Anti-capture protections:** Technical decisions made by research leads, not funders. Source code published under permissive licenses. Standards development in the open.

See our [funding strategy documentation](/funding) for details.

## Why Now?

The window for foundational work is closing. As AI capabilities surge, the brittleness compounds. The earlier we build semantic infrastructure, the less painful the transition.

**In 5 years**, either:
- We've built the substrate and AI systems are becoming more trustworthy, **or**
- We're drowning in hallucinations, accepting opaque governance, and living in the Grey Fog

SIF exists to make Timeline B possible.
