## ⚠️ STRATEGIC CROSSROADS (January 2026)

**CRITICAL:** SIL faces a fundamental strategic tension that requires immediate founder review.

**The Problem:**
- **SIL's approach:** "Building for decades" (10-20 year vision, Q1/Q2 2026 milestones)
- **AI reality:** AGI estimates 2-7 years (exponential acceleration, $200B/year investment)
- **Question:** Do these timelines make sense together?

**Three Scenarios:**
1. **Pre-AGI Sprint:** Race to ship infrastructure before AGI (RADICAL acceleration needed)
2. **Pattern Documentation:** Tools become obsolete, publish patterns/research instead
3. **Hedge Both:** Fast critical work + parallel research (moderate risk)

**Current pace (67% invariant enforcement, 30% Layer 1 complete) likely insufficient for Scenario 1.**

**Action Required:**
- [ ] **Run tests** (January-March 2026) - Progressive disclosure @ scale, regulatory requirements, hierarchical agency value
- [ ] **Make decision** (End Q1 2026) - Choose Scenario 1, 2, or 3 based on test results
- [ ] **Execute** - Commit fully to chosen path

**Documents:**
- **Full Assessment:** `/docs/meta/SIL_AGI_TIMELINE_STRATEGIC_ASSESSMENT.md` (comprehensive analysis)
- **Quick Reference:** `/docs/meta/AGI_TIMELINE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (decision framework)

**Status:** DRAFT - Awaiting founder review and decision

**This is the most important strategic question SIL faces. All other work should be evaluated through this lens.**

## Recent Milestones ✅

### December 20, 2025 — Architecture Decision Adopted

**ADOPTED:** Provenance-First model with Invariants Over Layers

**Completed:**
- ✅ Fixed P0 blocker in SEMANTIC_OS_ARCHITECTURE.md
- ✅ Created Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
- ✅ Validated confidence assessment (85-90%)
- ✅ Agent Ether implementation roadmap (16 weeks)
- ✅ Documentation synced to sil-website

**Evidence:**
- 6-session rigorous evaluation (Dec 14-20)
- Provenance-First scored 4.15 vs 3.05 for Canonical
- Perfect 1:1:1 mapping: THE_FORK → SCOPE_OF_HOPE → Invariants

## Current Architecture

### Provenance-First Layer Model

```
L6: Reflection       Learning from execution (Reveal)
L5: Execution        Deterministic computation (Morphogen)
L4: Composition      Cross-domain integration (Pantheon IR)
L3: Intent           Contracts and specifications (Agent Ether)
L2: Trust            Authorization (TAP)
L1: Meaning          Semantic understanding (Beth, Pantheon IR)
L0: Provenance       Cryptographic lineage (GenesisGraph)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
L-1: Substrate       Physical foundation (Philbrick, optional)
```

### Five Invariants (Mission Guarantees)

| Invariant | Prevents | Enforcement | Status |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Everything has lineage | Epistemic collapse | GenesisGraph v0.3.0 | ✅ Production |
| Reasoning is inspectable | Black box dictatorship | Reveal v0.25.0 | ✅ Production |
| Computation is grounded | Hallucinated science | Morphogen v0.12.0 | 🟡 Prototype |
| Contracts are explicit | Brittle complexity | Agent Ether 0.1.0-alpha | 🔴 Spec only |
| Efficiency is sustainable | Compute as privilege | Beth + Reveal | ✅ Production |

**Overall Enforcement:** 67% (3.5/5 production-ready)

## Priority Work

### 🔴 Critical: Agent Ether Implementation

**Status:** Spec only (0 Python files)
**Priority:** Highest (only invariant without tooling)
**Timeline:** 16 weeks (Q1 2026)

**Roadmap:**
- Phase 1: Registry + Metadata (4 weeks)
- Phase 2: Contract Validation (4 weeks)
- Phase 3: Runtime Enforcement (8 weeks)

**Location:** `/projects/agent-ether/ROADMAP.md`

### 🟡 Important: Morphogen v1.0

**Status:** v0.12.0 prototype (1,705 tests, 39 domains)
**Priority:** High
**Timeline:** Q2 2026
**Goal:** Production-distributed deterministic computation

---

## Active Projects

**Production Tools:**
- GenesisGraph v0.3.0 (provenance)
- Reveal v0.25.0 (progressive disclosure)
- Beth (semantic search, 14,549 files indexed)

**In Development:**
- Morphogen v0.12.0 → v1.0
- Agent Ether (spec → implementation)
- Pantheon IR (type system maturation)

**Infrastructure:**
- SIL Website (deployed, architecture docs updated)
- SIF Website (deployed)
- Infrastructure: 100% health (34/34 services)

## Next Steps

**📍 See `/docs/ROADMAP.md` for complete timeline and detailed breakdown**

**Immediate (Dec 20-27):**
- [ ] Approve consolidated roadmap (this replaces all prior planning docs)
- [ ] Archive historical planning docs (pre-launch artifacts)
- [ ] Commit Provenance-First architecture updates (uncommitted in SIL + sil-website)

**Week 1-2 (Q1 2026 Start):**
- [ ] Implement Intent verification primitives (`lib/pantheon/intent.py`, 4-6 hours)
- [ ] Assign Track 1 owner (Scott or hire FTE engineer)
- [ ] Weekly progress updates to IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md

**Q1 2026 (16 weeks):**
- [ ] Complete Track 1: Layer 1 Primitives (Intent, Uncertainty, Operators)
- [ ] Complete Track 2: Agent Ether Phases 1-3 (Contract enforcement)
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ invariant enforcement (4/5 production)

**Mission:** Building Timeline B (Glass Box future) instead of defaulting to Timeline A (Grey Fog)

**Status:** On track, architecture validated, known gaps documented with clear roadmap.
