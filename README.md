## 🎯 What is SIL?

The **Semantic Infrastructure Lab** builds the missing foundation that enables intelligent systems to reason with **explicit meaning**, not just statistical patterns.

Contemporary AI systems lack:
- **Explicit meaning** - Concepts and relationships as stable, inspectable structures
- **Stable memory** - Durable semantic continuity across tasks and time
- **Inspectable reasoning** - Traceable, reproducible chains of inference
- **Tool integration** - Composable operators across domains (audio, CAD, simulation)
- **Provenance** - Clear lineage of transformations and assumptions

**SIL exists to build this missing layer.**

## 🏗️ The Semantic OS

SIL's research centers on the **Semantic Operating System** - a 6-layer architecture:

```
Layer 5: Human Interfaces / SIM    (reveal, browserbridge)
Layer 4: Deterministic Engines      (morphogen, riffstack)
Layer 3: Multi-Agent Orchestration  (agent-ether)
Layer 2: Domain Modules             (morphogen, tiacad, riffstack, sup)
Layer 1: Universal Semantic IR      (pantheon)
Layer 0: Semantic Memory            (semantic-memory)

Cross-Cutting: Provenance           (genesisgraph, prism)
```

## 🎓 Core Principles

**Every SIL system follows 5 design principles:**

1. **Clarity** - Structure is visible, not hidden
2. **Simplicity** - Minimal essential complexity
3. **Composability** - Components combine cleanly
4. **Correctness** - Invariants are preserved
5. **Verifiability** - Reasoning is provable

Plus 9 more operational principles including:
- Structure before heuristics
- Meaning must be explicit
- Provenance everywhere
- Determinism when promised

## 🔬 Research Themes

SIL organizes around four research areas:

### 1. Universal Semantic Representations
How do we create IRs that work across domains?
- **pantheon** - Universal Semantic IR
- **morphogen** - Cross-domain composition

### 2. Domain-Specific Compilers
How do we compile semantic intent to execution?
- **morphogen** - Audio/physics → MLIR
- **riffstack** - Musical patterns → WebAudio
- **sup** - UI intent → React/Vue
- **tiacad** - Geometry → CAD engines

### 3. Microkernel Architectures
How do we build formally verified systems?
- **prism** - Microkernel query engine

### 4. Provenance & Verification
How do we prove computational correctness?
- **genesisgraph** - Verifiable provenance graphs

## 🎯 Use Cases

**What you can build with SIL infrastructure:**

### Cross-Domain Composition
Use **morphogen** to couple domains that never talked before:
```morphogen
# Couple fluid dynamics → acoustics → audio synthesis
use fluid, acoustics, audio

@state flow : FluidNetwork1D = engine_exhaust()
@state acoustic : AcousticField1D = waveguide_from_flow(flow)

flow(dt=0.1ms) {
    flow = flow.advance(engine_pulse(t))
    acoustic = acoustic.couple_from_fluid(flow)
    audio.play(acoustic.to_audio(mic_position=1.5m))
}
```

### Declarative CAD
Use **tiacad** for parametric 3D modeling in YAML:
```yaml
parts:
  - name: bracket
    type: box
    size: [50, 30, 10]
    operations:
      - type: fillet
        edges: all
        radius: 2
```

### Verifiable Provenance
Use **genesisgraph** to prove how things were made:
```yaml
process:
  inputs:
    - raw_data.csv
  transformations:
    - clean_data
    - train_model
  outputs:
    - model.pkl
  attestations:
    - type: compliance
      standard: "ISO-27001"
```
