SIL Research Agenda & Demonstration Plan (Year 1)

## 1. Purpose of the Research Agenda

This document defines SIL’s Year 1 research direction, success criteria, and demonstration goals across all layers of the Semantic Operating System. It is a planning and direction document intended to guide research focus, integration sequencing, and evaluation—not to serve as an implementation specification.

## 2. Year 1 Research Themes

Year 1 concentrates on establishing a minimal, coherent Semantic OS substrate and validating it through end-to-end demonstrations.

Theme A — Semantic Memory Foundation

Define and validate a persistent, interpretable, provenance-complete semantic graph with temporal history and transformation lineage.

Theme B — USIR v1 (Typed Semantic IR)

Deliver USIR v1 as a typed, explicit, graph-structured intermediate representation capable of expressing cross-domain structures and operator application.

Theme C — Early Domain Modules (Prototypes + Invariants)

Prototype 3–5 domain modules with schemas, invariants, operator families, and tool adapters sufficient for integrated workflows.

Theme D — Deterministic Orchestration for Reproducible Workflows

Implement a deterministic orchestration model for agent workflows, memory access, operator execution, and provenance logging.

Theme E — Human Interfaces / SIM v0 for Inspection and Exploration

Build minimal interfaces for semantic visualization, provenance inspection, and SIM-based exploration loops to support debugging and cross-domain pattern discovery.

## 3. Layer-by-Layer Objectives (Year 1)

Layer 0 — Semantic Memory (Objective)

Deliver a persistent semantic graph with explicit schemas, provenance, and temporal chains that can serve as the shared substrate across domains, agents, and interfaces.

Layer 1 — USIR (Objective)

Deliver USIR v1: a typed graph IR that can represent core structures in initial domains, express operator application, and support conceptual lowering/lifting between forms.

Layer 2 — Domain Modules (Objective)

Deliver prototype domain modules (CAD, simulation, code, scientific modeling, data workflows) each with: (a) schema, (b) invariants, (c) operator families, and (d) at least one tool-adapter prototype.

Layer 3 — Agent Orchestration (Objective)

Deliver deterministic orchestration primitives enabling: explicit task decomposition into operators, memory access protocols, reproducible workflow execution, and provenance for every agent action.

Layer 4 — Deterministic Engines (Objective)

Deliver early engine scaffolds and interfaces (symbolic + numeric + solver wrappers) that operate over USIR structures and enable reproducible execution with measurable correctness properties.

Layer 5 — Human Interfaces / SIM (Objective)

Deliver visualization and inspection tooling sufficient to: browse semantic graphs, inspect operator chains, review provenance and state changes, and run SIM v0 exploration workflows across at least two domains.

## 4. Semantic Memory Tasks (Year 1)

4.1 Initial Schema Design

Define core entity types: concept, relation, operator, artifact, workflow, derivation, assumption, domain, state snapshot.

Define linking primitives: typed edges, references, constraints, version identifiers, provenance pointers.

Define minimal query surface: retrieval by identifier, by type, by provenance chain, by domain, by dependency closure.

4.2 Persistence Model

Select and validate a persistence strategy supporting:

durable storage of graph nodes/edges

incremental updates

snapshots and restore

content/version addressing for stable references

Define serialization format(s) for interchange and testing.

4.3 Provenance Structures

Define provenance as a first-class graph with:

operator invocation records

input/output bindings

assumptions and parameters

tool/engine execution metadata

references to pre-state and post-state

Ensure provenance records are queryable and composable across workflows.

4.4 Temporal Chains

Define temporal modeling for semantic state:

event streams for changes

state snapshots at defined boundaries

lineage chains for artifacts and derived objects

Support “time-travel” inspection: reconstruct relevant state for a given derivation.

4.5 Validation Mechanisms

Define semantic validation rules for:

schema conformance

type compatibility

integrity constraints (referential, acyclicity where required, version consistency)

provenance completeness for specified operations

Establish test fixtures and reference cases to detect drift.

## 5. USIR Tasks (Year 1)

5.1 IR Syntax and Semantics Definition

Define USIR as a typed, explicit, graph-structured IR with:

nodes representing typed entities (values, structures, operators, constraints, workflows)

edges representing typed relations (containment, dependency, derivation, constraint, execution)

Define evaluation semantics at the level needed for operator application and provenance traces.

5.2 Type System Scaffolding

Define initial type fragments spanning:

symbolic expressions

numeric scalars/vectors/tensors

geometric primitives and constraints

program structures (functions, types, control/data flow objects at a suitable abstraction level)

workflow constructs (steps, artifacts, dependencies, parameters)

Define rules for type checking of operator inputs/outputs.

5.3 Lowering/Lifting Rules (Conceptual)

Define the conceptual mapping classes required for:

symbolic ↔ numeric

geometry/CAD ↔ simulation

code structure ↔ analyses/refactors

workflow graphs ↔ executable orchestration

Document lowering/lifting contracts rather than full algorithms (Year 1 focus is coherence and testability).

5.4 Operator Model

Define operator objects with:

signatures (typed inputs/outputs)

preconditions/postconditions

declared effects on semantic state

provenance emission requirements

Establish a minimal operator execution contract used by engines and orchestration.

5.5 Cross-Domain Compatibility Targets

Specify target compatibility in Year 1:

shared operator and provenance representation across at least three domains

common constraint representation usable by at least two domains

unified workflow representation spanning domain module outputs and engine inputs

9.4 Cross-Domain Pattern Discovery Loops

Establish at least two closed loops where interface-driven exploration feeds improvements back into:

USIR representational gaps

operator definitions

Track these loops as explicit artifacts in semantic memory (discovery → proposal → integration).

## 10. Cross-Layer Integration Milestones (Year 1)

Integration is treated as a first-class deliverable. Year 1 checkpoints:

M1 — Memory ↔ USIR Base Integration

USIR objects and operator invocations are persistable in semantic memory with provenance and temporal history.

M2 — Domain Module ↔ USIR Integration (Two Domains Minimum)

At least two domain modules can represent core objects in USIR and exchange artifacts through USIR with typed compatibility checks.

M3 — Domain Module ↔ Engine Integration (One Engine Path)

At least one domain module drives an engine through USIR operator execution, producing typed results with provenance.

M4 — Agents ↔ Memory Integration

Agent orchestration reads/writes semantic memory using defined protocols, with reproducible workflow replay.

M5 — Agents ↔ Tools/Engines Integration

Agents execute operator graphs that route into domain adapters and engines deterministically, written as provenance-complete workflows.

M6 — SIM ↔ All Layers (Inspection Coverage)

SIM/Interfaces can inspect: memory objects, USIR graphs, domain objects, agent actions, engine runs, and workflow provenance for at least one end-to-end demo.

## 11. End-to-End Demonstrations (Year 1)

Year 1 demonstrations must be complete, inspectable, and reproducible within defined constraints.

Demo 1 — CAD → Simulation → Analysis

Represent a parametric geometry object and constraints (CAD domain).

Lower into a simulation-ready model via USIR (simulation domain).

Execute a solver run through the engine interface with provenance-complete records.

Inspect the full chain end-to-end in the reasoning inspector (inputs, operators, state, outputs).

Demo 2 — Code → Semantics → Deterministic Tool Routing

Parse a codebase subset into semantic structures (code domain).

Construct dependency/structure objects and invariants.

Route a deterministic transformation or analysis toolchain (e.g., refactor + verification) via operator graphs.

Preserve and inspect provenance across transformations and validate invariant preservation.

Demo 3 — Symbolic → Numeric → Provenance-Inspected Results

Define a symbolic scientific model with explicit assumptions (scientific modeling domain).

Lower to numeric execution (engine interface) with typed bindings.

Produce results objects with provenance, validation artifacts, and replay capability.

Inspect transformation steps, assumptions, and solver configuration through the reasoning inspector.

Demo 4 (Optional, if capacity allows) — SIM-Driven Invariant Exploration

Use SIM v0 to navigate semantic objects and provenance chains.

Identify and test candidate invariants across at least two domains (e.g., geometry constraints ↔ simulation boundary conditions).

Produce a recorded “discovery loop” artifact: observation → proposed invariant/operator → integration proposal.

## 12. Evaluation Criteria (Year 1)

Progress is measured by system properties, not output fluency.

Semantic Clarity

Objects are representable as typed, inspectable structures.

Operators have explicit signatures and contracts.

Provenance Completeness

Operator invocations, inputs/outputs, assumptions, and state transitions are recorded.

Provenance supports traversal and reconstruction of derivations.

Cross-Domain Coherence

USIR supports shared structures across at least two domains without ad hoc translation.

Domain modules maintain compatibility through typed interfaces.

Reproducibility

Defined workflows can be replayed with equivalent results under stated equivalence relations and tolerances.

Divergence is detectable and diagnosable.

Operator Correctness

Operators preserve stated invariants or fail with explicit diagnostics.

Minimal validation exists for key operators in each demo path.

Integration Stability

Cross-layer contracts remain stable across iterations (memory ↔ USIR ↔ domains ↔ orchestration ↔ engines ↔ interfaces).

Changes are versioned and do not silently break demonstrations.

## 13. Risks & Mitigations (Year 1)

Risk: Over-expansion of scope across domains

Mitigation:
 Limit to prototype-level schemas and operator families; require every domain task to tie directly to a Year 1 demo path.

Risk: USIR becomes either too abstract or too domain-specific

Mitigation:
 Define USIR v1 minimally around operator execution, provenance, and typed graph structures; validate via integration milestones M2/M3.

Risk: Provenance overhead undermines usability or velocity

Mitigation:
 Establish minimum provenance requirements per operator class; implement progressive detail levels while preserving traceability.

Risk: Reproducibility claims exceed practical determinism constraints

Mitigation:
 Define explicit equivalence relations and tolerances; encode determinism boundaries in run metadata and evaluation.

Risk: Agent orchestration becomes a research sink

Mitigation:
 Keep agent work focused on deterministic workflow execution and provenance capture; avoid broad autonomy goals.

Risk: Interfaces become product-level scope

Mitigation:
 Interfaces are inspection and debugging tools for Year 1; prioritize reasoning inspector and semantic visualization over feature breadth.

Risk: Integration churn blocks progress

Mitigation:
 Treat integration milestones as primary deliverables; require contract tests for memory/USIR/operator interfaces.

## 14. Non-Goals for Year 1

Building or training probabilistic language models.

Achieving universal domain coverage or encyclopedic ontologies.

Delivering product-grade UI/UX or commercial platforms.

Solving full agent autonomy or open-ended planning.

Producing a complete formal specification for all lowering/lifting semantics.

Guaranteeing strict determinism across all numeric engines/hardware environments.

Optimizing for large-scale performance at the expense of representational stability.

Competing with existing ML labs on model capability benchmarks.

This document constitutes the SIL Research Agenda & Demonstration Plan for Year 1.
