# AGI Timeline Strategic Assessment - Quick Reference

**Full Document:** [SIL_AGI_TIMELINE_STRATEGIC_ASSESSMENT.md](./SIL_AGI_TIMELINE_STRATEGIC_ASSESSMENT.md)

**Created:** 2026-01-01
**Status:** CRITICAL - Requires immediate founder decision

---

## The Core Problem

**SIL says:** "Building for decades, not quarters" (10-20 year vision)

**AI reality:** AGI estimates 2-7 years (exponential acceleration)

**Question:** Do these timelines make sense together?

---

## Three Mutually Exclusive Scenarios

### 🏃 Scenario 1: Pre-AGI Infrastructure (Race Against Time)

**Thesis:** We're building substrate AGI will need. Must ship before AGI arrives.

**Action:** RADICAL acceleration
- Agent Ether: 2 weeks (not 16 weeks)
- Layer 1 primitives: Sprint mode
- All critical gaps: Closed by end of 2026

**Risk:** Can't accelerate fast enough (current pace too slow)

---

### 📚 Scenario 2: Post-AGI Principles (Pattern Documentation)

**Thesis:** Tools will be obsolete, but PATTERNS survive (progressive disclosure, hierarchical agency, provenance-first).

**Action:** Pivot to research publication
- Document patterns as RFCs/papers
- Use current tools as proof-of-concept
- Publish by mid-2026

**Risk:** Research without production adoption often ignored

---

### 🎯 Scenario 3: Hedge Both Paths (Uncertainty)

**Thesis:** AGI timeline uncertain. Pursue BOTH fast tools AND pattern documentation.

**Action:** Dual-track strategy
- High-value hedges only (Agent Ether + papers)
- Fast critical work (2-4 week sprints)
- Patterns published in parallel

**Risk:** Diluted effort, neither path succeeds

---

## Testable Hypotheses (Answer in 3 Months)

| Hypothesis | Test | Timeline | Decision Impact |
|------------|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Progressive Disclosure @ Scale** | Test Reveal with Claude 3 Opus (200K context) | 2 weeks | Does efficiency matter at scale? |
| **Regulatory Requirements** | Interview EU AI Act + medical/financial AI teams | 4 weeks | Is provenance legally required? |
| **Hierarchical Agency Value** | Deploy & measure vs. flat architecture | 6 weeks | Does architecture improve agents? |
| **Determinism Enables Science** | Morphogen scientific computing pilot | 8 weeks | Is reproducibility critical? |

---

## Decision Framework (End of Q1 2026)

**If 3-4 tests positive:** → Scenario 1 (Wartime Sprint)

**If 2-3 tests positive:** → Scenario 3 (Hedge Both)

**If 0-2 tests positive:** → Scenario 2 (Research Pivot)

---

## Immediate Actions (January 2026)

### Week 1-2:
- [ ] Test progressive disclosure @ 200K context (Claude 3 Opus)
- [ ] Interview 3-5 EU AI Act implementers
- [ ] Interview 3-5 medical/financial AI teams

### Week 3-4:
- [ ] Agent Ether sprint decision (based on test results)
- [ ] 2-week sprint OR 4-week implementation OR spec only

### Month 2-3:
- [ ] Hierarchical agency deployment + test
- [ ] Morphogen scientific computing pilot
- [ ] Evaluate all results

### End Q1 2026:
- [ ] **STRATEGIC DECISION:** Choose Scenario 1, 2, or 3
- [ ] Commit fully to chosen path
- [ ] Execute with clarity

## Key Questions for Founder

**Most critical:**
1. Which scenario do you believe is most likely?
2. What's your AGI timeline estimate? (2-3y, 4-5y, 6-10y, 10+y)
3. If tests show high value but timeline compressed, can you radically accelerate?

**Resource reality:**
4. Hours/week you can dedicate? _____ hrs
5. Need funding for team? Y/N (If yes: $_____ for _____ months)
6. Can you personally execute wartime sprint? Y/N

**Success definition:**
7. What does "SIL success" look like in 2029?
8. If you choose ONE contribution that matters most, what is it?

---

## The Brutal Truth

**Current pace:**
- 67% invariant enforcement (3.5/5 production)
- Layer 1: 30% complete (critical bottleneck)
- Agent Ether: Spec only, 0 Python files (16-week timeline)

**If AGI arrives in 3 years:**
- SIL has ~18 months to prove/deploy core ideas
- Cathedral-building doesn't finish in time
- Either sprint now OR pivot to research

**Worst outcome:**
Continue current pace while AGI arrives mid-implementation.

**Better outcome:**
Choose a path (even if wrong) and commit fully.

## Next Steps

1. **Read full assessment:** [SIL_AGI_TIMELINE_STRATEGIC_ASSESSMENT.md](./SIL_AGI_TIMELINE_STRATEGIC_ASSESSMENT.md)
2. **Run tests:** January-March 2026
3. **Make decision:** End of Q1 2026
4. **Execute:** Commit to chosen path

**Status:** DRAFT - Awaiting founder review

**This is the most important strategic question SIL faces.**
