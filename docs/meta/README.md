# SIL Meta Documentation

**Purpose:** Documentation ABOUT SIL (not technical architecture or research)

This directory contains meta-level documents about:
- Founder background and influences
- Strategic planning and decision-making
- Research agendas and safety thresholds
- Tool quality monitoring and governance
- FAQs and guidance for contributors

---

## 🚨 Start Here (January 2026)

### Critical Strategic Assessment

**SIL faces a fundamental strategic question:**

Does a 10-20 year "cathedral-building" approach make sense when AGI estimates are 2-7 years?

**Required reading:**
1. **[AGI_TIMELINE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./AGI_TIMELINE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** (5 min) - Decision framework
2. **[SIL_AGI_TIMELINE_STRATEGIC_ASSESSMENT.md](./SIL_AGI_TIMELINE_STRATEGIC_ASSESSMENT.md)** (30 min) - Full analysis

**Action timeline:**
- **January-March 2026:** Run testable hypotheses
- **End Q1 2026:** Strategic decision (Sprint vs. Research vs. Hedge)
- **Q2 2026+:** Execute chosen path

**Status:** DRAFT - Awaiting founder review

## Key Strategic Questions (January 2026)

### 1. Theory of Change

**Which scenario is most likely?**
- [ ] Pre-AGI Infrastructure (race against time)
- [ ] Post-AGI Principles (tools obsolete, patterns survive)
- [ ] Uncertainty Hedge (dual-track approach)

**What's your AGI timeline estimate?**
- [ ] 2-3 years (2026-2027)
- [ ] 4-5 years (2028-2029)
- [ ] 6-10 years (2030-2034)
- [ ] 10+ years (2035+)

### 2. Resource Reality

**Current pace achieves:**
- 67% invariant enforcement (3.5/5 production-ready)
- 30% Layer 1 completion (critical bottleneck)
- Agent Ether: Spec only, 0 Python files (16-week timeline)

**To reach 100% by end of 2026, what's required?**
- Hours/week you can dedicate: _____ hrs
- Need funding for team? Y/N
- If funding needed: $_____ for _____ months
- Can you personally execute wartime sprint? Y/N

### 3. Success Definition

**What does "SIL success" look like in 2029?**
- [ ] Production systems deployed and adopted (tools matter)
- [ ] Patterns documented and cited (research matters)
- [ ] Safety standards adopted by industry (governance matters)
- [ ] AGI uses SIL substrate (infrastructure matters)

**If you choose ONE contribution that matters most:**
- [ ] Progressive Disclosure protocol
- [ ] Morphogen's deterministic cross-domain unification
- [ ] Hierarchical Agency framework
- [ ] Provenance-first architecture
- [ ] Complete Semantic OS vision

---

## Testable Hypotheses (January-March 2026)

### Test 1: Progressive Disclosure @ Scale (2 weeks)
**Question:** Does structure-first navigation matter at 200K+ context?
**Method:** Test Reveal with Claude 3 Opus (200K context)
**Measure:** Token usage, reasoning quality, session length, error rates

### Test 2: Regulatory Requirements (4 weeks)
**Question:** Will regulations force provenance systems?
**Method:** Interview EU AI Act implementers + medical/financial AI teams
**Measure:** Hard requirements timeline, compliance costs, legal clarity

### Test 3: Hierarchical Agency Value (6 weeks)
**Question:** Does gradient-of-agency improve agent performance?
**Method:** Deploy hierarchical system vs. flat architecture
**Measure:** Task completion, error rates, cost, human intervention frequency

### Test 4: Determinism for Science (8 weeks)
**Question:** Is bitwise reproducibility critical for scientific AI?
**Method:** Morphogen pilot with scientific computing users
**Measure:** Reproducibility, audit trail quality, researcher adoption

## Decision Framework (End Q1 2026)

**If 3-4 tests positive:**
→ **Scenario 1 (Pre-AGI Sprint)**
→ Action: Radical acceleration, wartime mode
→ Timeline: All critical gaps closed by end of 2026

**If 2-3 tests positive:**
→ **Scenario 3 (Hedge Both Paths)**
→ Action: Fast tools + research papers in parallel
→ Timeline: High-value hedges by Q2 2026, patterns published by Q4 2026

**If 0-2 tests positive:**
→ **Scenario 2 (Pattern Documentation)**
→ Action: Pivot to research publication
→ Timeline: Core papers submitted by mid-2026

## Document Maintenance

**Update this README when:**
- New strategic documents added
- Major decisions made (record in README)
- FAQs need updating (quarterly review)
- Founder background changes (new milestones)

**Owner:** Scott Senkeresty (Founder)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-01
**Next Review:** End Q1 2026 (March 31, 2026)

## Contributing to Meta Documentation

**These documents should:**
- Be honest and transparent (glass-box principle)
- Focus on decision-making (not just description)
- Include testable hypotheses (empirical grounding)
- Acknowledge uncertainty (no false confidence)
- Update based on new evidence (living documents)

**Writing style:**
- Direct and clear (no academic jargon)
- Bulleted and scannable (busy founders)
- Action-oriented (what to do, not just what to think)
- Evidence-based (cite sources, measurements, examples)

**See also:** [MARKDOWN_STYLE_GUIDE.md](./MARKDOWN_STYLE_GUIDE.md)

**The meta layer is where SIL thinks about itself. Use it well.**
