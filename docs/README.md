## Try It Now

**reveal** - Progressive code exploration that reduces AI agent token usage by 86%:

```bash
pip install reveal-cli
reveal your_code.py
```

See structure first (50 tokens) instead of reading entire files (500+ tokens). Progressive disclosure applied to code.

## What is SIL?

The **Semantic Infrastructure Lab** builds open infrastructure that makes intelligent systems inspectable and reliable.

Contemporary AI systems are powerful but lack:
- **Explicit meaning** - Stable, inspectable semantic structures
- **Persistent memory** - Durable continuity across tasks
- **Inspectable reasoning** - Traceable chains of inference
- **Cross-domain composition** - Audio, CAD, simulation working together
- **Verifiable provenance** - Clear lineage of transformations

**SIL builds this missing layer: the Semantic Operating System** - a 6-layer architecture providing semantic memory, universal representations, deterministic execution, multi-agent coordination, and transparent interfaces.

**Status:** 12 projects, 4 in production, 3,100+ tests, used daily in real workflows.
