# Manifesto

## [YOLO](/manifesto/YOLO)

**You Only Learn Once: On the Compression of Experience**

*The soul document of the Semantic Infrastructure Lab*

---

### What is YOLO?

YOLO is SIL's manifesto—a demonstration of the compression thesis in both form and content. It's literary, philosophical, and technical all at once.

**The thesis:** Intelligence emerges from progressive compression of experience. Meaning is what survives compression.

**Why titled YOLO?**
- Subversion signals we're serious (anyone can be earnest)
- Demonstrates compression: common phrase → profound technical insight
- "You Only Learn Once" is literally about compression and transfer
- The title IS the thesis demonstrated

### When to Use This Document

**Recommended for:**
- Founders, researchers, philosophers
- People who want to understand *why* SIL exists
- Technical audiences who appreciate literary compression
- Media and cultural contexts

**Alternative entry points:**
- **Technical audience?** Start with [Founder's Letter](/foundations/FOUNDERS_LETTER)
- **Want architecture?** See [Semantic OS Architecture](/foundations/SIL_SEMANTIC_OS_ARCHITECTURE)
- **Institutional funder?** Use The Fork (session document, ask for access)

### Reading Time

10 minutes for first pass, lifetime for full depth.

*YOLO demonstrates what we preach: compression, progressive disclosure, and meaning made explicit.*
