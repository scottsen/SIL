# SIL Foundations

**Core principles, architecture, and founding documents**

## Core Documents

### [Founder's Letter](/foundations/FOUNDERS_LETTER)
The foundational "steel infrastructure" metaphor. Why SIL exists and what we're building.

*5 minute read*

---

### [Architectural Principles](/foundations/architectural-principles)
14 foundational constraints that govern the Semantic OS architecture:

- Structure Before Heuristics
- Meaning Must Be Explicit
- Provenance Everywhere
- Invariants Define Correctness
- Cross-Domain Coherence

### [Design Principles](/foundations/design-principles)
9 applied principles for building SIL-aligned systems:

1. Progressive Disclosure (foundational)
2. Semantic-First Design
3. Glass Box Transparency
4. Composition Over Monoliths
5. Test-Driven Quality

## Architecture

### [Semantic OS Architecture](/foundations/SIL_SEMANTIC_OS_ARCHITECTURE)
Complete 7-layer Semantic Operating System specification:

- Layer 0: Semantic Memory
- Layer 1: Universal Semantic IR (Pantheon)
- Layer 2: Domain Modules
- Layer 3: Agent Orchestration
- Layer 4: Deterministic Execution Engines
- Layer 5: Human Interfaces
- Cross-Cutting: Provenance & Policy

### [Technical Charter](/foundations/SIL_TECHNICAL_CHARTER)
Governance, contribution guidelines, and technical decision-making process.

---

## Reference

### [Glossary](/foundations/SIL_GLOSSARY)
Canonical definitions for 100+ SIL terms and concepts.

---

## Legacy

### [Semantic OS Architecture (Original Manifesto)](/foundations/semantic-os-architecture)
The original SIL manifesto, now superseded by the expanded architecture document above. Preserved for historical continuity.

---

*These foundations define what makes SIL different: explicit meaning, inspectable reasoning, and semantic infrastructure that lasts.*
