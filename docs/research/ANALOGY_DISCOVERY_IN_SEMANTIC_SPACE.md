## Abstract

Vector embeddings capture semantic similarity through proximity in high-dimensional space. However, the most powerful form of semantic reasoning—**cross-domain analogy**—requires discovering and navigating *directional transformations* that preserve relational structure across conceptually distant domains.

This paper presents a geometric framework for **analogy discovery as manifold navigation**, where analogies are formalized as structure-preserving transformations between semantic submanifolds. We show that:

1. Analogies form a low-dimensional subspace of the embedding manifold (the **analogy manifold** M_A)
2. High-quality cross-domain analogies preserve topological neighborhoods under transport
3. Domain-to-domain translation can be systematized through centroid operations and residual analysis
4. This framework enables computational discovery of novel analogies, not just retrieval of known ones

We connect this work to SIL's broader research on semantic manifold transport (RAG systems), semantic observability (intent-execution alignment), and hierarchical agency (multi-agent reasoning with provenance).

**Keywords:** semantic analogies, cross-domain reasoning, manifold transport, vector embeddings, relational structure preservation, computational creativity

## 1. Introduction: From Similarity to Analogy

### 1.1 The Limitation of Proximity-Based Semantics

Modern embedding models excel at capturing **distributional similarity**:
- `hot` is close to `warm`, `cold`, `temperature`
- `dog` is close to `canine`, `puppy`, `animal`
- `hot dog` is close to `sausage`, `frankfurter`, `food`

This proximity-based semantics works well for retrieval, clustering, and similarity search. However, it fundamentally misses the kind of reasoning that drives scientific breakthroughs, literary insight, and creative problem-solving: **cross-domain analogy**.

### 1.2 Analogies as Directional Transformations

The canonical example from word embedding research:

```
king - man + woman ≈ queen
```

This is not about similarity. Instead, it reveals a **directional relationship**:
- The vector from `man` to `king` captures "becomes monarch"
- The vector from `woman` to `queen` captures the same relationship
- The analogy works because these vectors are *parallel* (or nearly so)

**Key insight:** Analogies are relationships between *directions*, not between *positions*.

### 1.3 The Schrödinger Example: Cross-Domain Analogy as Scientific Method

Erwin Schrödinger's 1926 derivation of quantum mechanics provides a canonical example of analogy-driven discovery:

He noticed a structural similarity:
```
Hamilton-Jacobi equation     ∂S/∂t + H(q, ∇S) = 0     [classical mechanics]
       ↕ (analogy)
Eikonal equation             ∂φ/∂t + c|∇φ| = 0        [geometric optics]
```

The analogy mapping:
```
Action S        ↔  Optical phase φ
Momentum ∇S     ↔  Wave vector k
Trajectories    ↔  Light rays
Energy surfaces ↔  Wavefronts
```

This wasn't just pattern-matching—it was **structure-preserving cross-domain transport**. Schrödinger followed this analogy to complexify the action (`S → ψ = e^(iS/ℏ)`) and derive the Schrödinger equation.

**Research question:** Can we systematize this kind of discovery?

### 1.4 The Goal of This Research

We propose a **computational framework** for:

1. **Discovering** high-quality analogies between conceptually distant domains
2. **Measuring** analogy quality through geometric criteria (structure preservation)
3. **Generating** candidate analogies for exploration (computational creativity)
4. **Navigating** the space of possible analogies (the analogy manifold M_A)

This is not pattern-matching or keyword search. It is **geometric reasoning over semantic structure**.

---

## 2. Theoretical Framework: Analogies as Manifold Transformations

### 2.1 Notation and Definitions

Let **M_E** be the embedding manifold—the high-dimensional space where semantic vectors live.

Let **D_A** and **D_B** be two semantic domains (submanifolds of M_E):
- D_A might be "classical mechanics" (concepts: action, momentum, trajectory, Hamiltonian...)
- D_B might be "geometric optics" (concepts: phase, wave vector, ray, eikonal...)

An **analogy** is a mapping `φ: D_A → D_B` that preserves relational structure.

**Formal definition:**

> An analogy `a:b :: c:d` holds when the vector transformation `v_ab = embed(b) - embed(a)` is approximately parallel to `v_cd = embed(d) - embed(c)`, and this parallelism preserves local neighborhoods.

### 2.2 Analogy Quality Metrics

Not all vector arithmetic produces meaningful analogies. We define quality through **structural preservation**:

#### Criterion 1: Vector Parallelism

```
parallel_score(a, b, c, d) = cosine_similarity(v_ab, v_cd)
```

where `v_ab = embed(b) - embed(a)` and `v_cd = embed(d) - embed(c)`.

High parallelism (>0.8) suggests the same relational transformation operates in both contexts.

#### Criterion 2: Neighborhood Preservation

An analogy should preserve semantic neighborhoods under transport.

Define the **transported neighborhood**:
```
N_a = {n : n is among k-nearest neighbors of a in D_A}
N_c_transported = {n + (embed(c) - embed(a)) : n ∈ N_a}
```

Then:
```
neighborhood_preservation(a, c) = |N_c_transported ∩ N_c| / |N_c|
```

where `N_c` is the actual neighborhood of `c` in D_B.

If neighborhoods preserve well (>0.6), the analogy respects local semantic structure.

#### Criterion 3: Centroid Alignment (Domain-Level)

For cross-domain analogies, we expect domain centroids to align:

```
C_A = (1/|D_A|) Σ embed(x) for x in D_A
C_B = (1/|D_B|) Σ embed(y) for y in D_B

domain_translation = C_B - C_A
```

Individual concept analogies should roughly follow this global translation:
```
alignment_score(a, c) = cosine_similarity(embed(c) - embed(a), domain_translation)
```

High alignment (>0.7) suggests the analogy follows systematic domain mapping.

### 2.3 The Analogy Manifold M_A

**Hypothesis:** High-quality analogies do not span the entire embedding space randomly. They occupy a **low-dimensional subspace** of M_E.

Define the **analogy manifold** M_A as:
```
M_A = {(a, b, c, d) ∈ M_E^4 : quality(a, b, c, d) > threshold}
```

**Research questions:**
1. What is the intrinsic dimensionality of M_A?
2. Can we learn a projection π: M_E^4 → M_A that filters for high-quality analogies?
3. Do different types of analogies (taxonomic, functional, causal) cluster within M_A?

### 2.4 Cross-Domain Translation as Geometric Transport

Given a concept `a` in domain D_A, find its analogy `c` in domain D_B:

**Algorithm: Domain-Centroid Transport**

1. Compute domain centroids C_A and C_B
2. Compute concept's position relative to its domain:
   `offset = embed(a) - C_A`
3. Transport to target domain:
   `candidate = C_B + offset`
4. Find nearest neighbors in D_B to `candidate`
5. Score candidates by full analogy quality metrics

**Intuition:** This treats domains as parallel coordinate systems. The analogy `a ↔ c` preserves *relative position within domain*.

## 3. Connection to Existing SIL Research

### 3.1 RAG as Semantic Manifold Transport

SIL's existing research on [RAG as Semantic Manifold Transport](RAG_AS_SEMANTIC_MANIFOLD_TRANSPORT.md) identifies four misaligned manifolds:

- M_H: Human conceptual space
- M_E: Embedding space
- M_L: LLM latent space
- M_F: Fusion space

**Analogy discovery operates primarily in M_E**, but its outputs must be interpretable in M_H and usable in M_L:

- **M_E → M_H transport:** Discovered analogies must be explainable to humans ("Action is like optical phase because...")
- **M_E → M_L transport:** LLMs must be able to reason with discovered analogies

The **centroid-based transport** method proposed here is a structured way to minimize distortion during M_E → M_E cross-domain transport.

### 3.2 Semantic Observability: Analogy as Alignment Detection

SIL's work on [Semantic Observability](../canonical/SEMANTIC_OBSERVABILITY.md) measures alignment between intent and execution.

**Analogies reveal alignment across domains:**

If `classical_mechanics ↔ geometric_optics` has high-quality mappings, it suggests deep structural alignment—not just surface similarity.

This can be measured through:
- **Residual analysis:** How much structure is lost during cross-domain transport?
- **Bidirectional consistency:** Does D_A → D_B → D_A recover the original concepts?

### 3.3 Hierarchical Agency: Multi-Agent Analogy Search

From the [Hierarchical Agency Framework](../canonical/HIERARCHICAL_AGENCY_FRAMEWORK.md), analogy discovery can be orchestrated across multiple agents:

- **Sage:** Explores high-level cross-domain patterns
- **Beth:** Provides domain concept graphs for neighborhood analysis
- **Goob:** Scores analogy quality through geometric validation
- **Cora:** Tracks provenance of discovered analogies

**Multi-agent workflow:**
1. Beth identifies domain boundaries and concept clusters
2. Sage proposes candidate cross-domain mappings
3. Goob validates through geometric criteria
4. Cora records derivation lineage (how was this analogy discovered?)

### 3.4 USIR: Encoding Analogies as Operators

The [Universal Semantic IR](../canonical/SIL_TECHNICAL_CHARTER.md#layer-1-usir) provides structured representation.

**Discovered analogies become USIR operators:**

```yaml
operator:
  id: "classical_mechanics_to_geometric_optics"
  type: "cross_domain_analogy"
  from_domain: "classical_mechanics"
  to_domain: "geometric_optics"

  mappings:
    - source_concept: "action_S"
      target_concept: "optical_phase_φ"
      quality_score: 0.94
      preserves: ["first_order_PDE_structure", "variational_principle"]

    - source_concept: "momentum_p"
      target_concept: "wave_vector_k"
      quality_score: 0.91
      preserves: ["gradient_relationship", "conserved_quantity"]

  domain_translation_vector: [...]  # Centroid offset
  neighborhood_preservation: 0.87
  discovered_by: "agent:sage"
  validated_by: "agent:goob"
  provenance: "centroid_transport_method"
```

This makes analogies **first-class semantic objects** with provenance, quality metrics, and structural guarantees.

## 4. Experimental Design: Seven Research Directions

### Experiment 1: Analogy Subspace Discovery (Dimensionality Reduction)

**Goal:** Find the intrinsic dimensionality of M_A.

**Method:**
1. Collect 10,000+ known analogies (linguistic, scientific, literary)
2. Compute 4D embedding tuples `(a, b, c, d)` for each analogy
3. Run PCA/UMAP to find low-dimensional structure
4. Measure: Do high-quality analogies cluster in low-dimensional subspace?

**Expected outcome:** M_A has intrinsic dimension ~50-200 (much lower than M_E's 768/1536).

### Experiment 2: Cross-Domain Discovery (Schrödinger Test)

**Goal:** Rediscover Schrödinger's classical mechanics ↔ optics analogy.

**Method:**
1. Define domain D_A = {classical mechanics concepts from textbooks}
2. Define domain D_B = {geometric optics concepts}
3. Apply centroid-transport algorithm for each concept in D_A
4. Measure: Do we recover known mappings (action ↔ phase, momentum ↔ wave vector)?

**Success criterion:** Top-3 candidates include historically correct analogies with quality >0.85.

### Experiment 3: Novel Analogy Generation

**Goal:** Discover *new* cross-domain analogies not documented in literature.

**Method:**
1. Pick two unrelated domains (e.g., "thermodynamics" and "information theory")
2. Systematically search for high-quality mappings
3. Human expert validation: Are these meaningful?

**Expected discoveries:**
- Entropy ↔ Shannon entropy (already known, validates method)
- Temperature ↔ ??? (research question!)
- Partition function ↔ ??? (research question!)

### Experiment 4: Analogy Type Classification

**Goal:** Do different analogy types (functional, causal, taxonomic, proportional) cluster differently in M_A?

**Method:**
1. Label analogies by type
2. Train classifier to predict analogy type from embedding geometry
3. Measure: Can we distinguish "is-a" from "causes" from "analogous-to" purely geometrically?

### Experiment 5: Temporal Analogy Drift

**Goal:** Do analogies change over time as language/science evolves?

**Method:**
1. Use historical corpora (1900, 1950, 2000, 2025)
2. Measure analogy quality across time periods
3. Track: How did "atom ↔ solar system" analogy decay as quantum mechanics emerged?

### Experiment 6: Multi-Hop Analogy Chains

**Goal:** Can we chain analogies? If A ↔ B and B ↔ C, does A ↔ C?

**Method:**
1. Find analogy A ↔ B (e.g., classical mechanics ↔ optics)
2. Find analogy B ↔ C (e.g., optics ↔ quantum mechanics)
3. Test: Does A ↔ C hold directly? (classical ↔ quantum)

**Expected result:** Multi-hop analogies degrade (quality score decreases) but may reveal novel connections.

### Experiment 7: Bidirectional Consistency

**Goal:** Are analogies symmetric? Does D_A → D_B → D_A recover original concepts?

**Method:**
1. Transport concept `a` from D_A to D_B → get `c`
2. Transport `c` back from D_B to D_A → get `a'`
3. Measure: `distance(a, a')`

**Hypothesis:** High-quality analogies have low round-trip error (<0.2).

## 5. Implementation Considerations (Architecture-Agnostic)

While this research is independent of specific tooling, any implementation requires:

### 5.1 Core Capabilities

1. **Vector embeddings** (e.g., OpenAI, Voyage, sentence-transformers)
2. **Domain identification** (clustering, topic modeling, manual curation)
3. **Centroid computation** (efficient aggregation over domain subsets)
4. **Nearest-neighbor search** (FAISS, Annoy, or similar)
5. **Quality scoring** (vector operations, neighborhood lookups)
6. **Provenance tracking** (how was this analogy discovered?)

### 5.2 Computational Complexity

- **Single analogy validation:** O(k) for k-NN lookup
- **Cross-domain search:** O(|D_A| × k) for full systematic search
- **Analogy manifold PCA:** O(n × d²) where n = number of analogies, d = embedding dimension

For 10M embeddings and 1000-concept domains, this is computationally tractable on modern hardware.

### 5.3 Data Requirements

**Minimum viable:**
- 100K+ embeddings spanning multiple domains
- 1K+ known analogies for validation
- Domain labels or clustering

**Ideal:**
- 10M+ embeddings (comprehensive coverage)
- 100K+ known analogies (training/validation)
- Multi-modal data (text, code, scientific literature)
- Temporal versions (historical corpora)

- **Q2:** Can we prove bounds on analogy quality degradation under multi-hop transport?
- **Q3:** Are there universal analogy types that appear across all domains?
- **Q4:** What geometric invariants distinguish high-quality from spurious analogies?

## 7. Relation to Existing Work

### 7.1 Cognitive Science: Structure-Mapping Theory

Gentner's **Structure-Mapping Theory** (1983) proposes that analogies preserve relational structure, not surface features.

**SIL contribution:** Operationalize this geometrically. "Relational structure" becomes **topological neighborhood preservation** in embedding space.

### 7.2 NLP: Word Embeddings and Analogy Tasks

Mikolov et al. (2013) demonstrated `king - man + woman = queen` in Word2Vec.

**SIL contribution:** Generalize from single-word analogies to **cross-domain conceptual mappings** with quality metrics and provenance.

### 7.3 Knowledge Graphs: Cross-Domain Reasoning

Knowledge graphs encode explicit relations (e.g., DBpedia, Wikidata).

**SIL contribution:** Discover implicit cross-domain analogies that graphs don't encode. "Action" and "optical phase" have no explicit link in Wikipedia, but geometric analogy reveals their relationship.

### 7.4 AI Creativity: GOFAI Analogical Reasoning

Systems like SME (Structure-Mapping Engine) and FARG (Fluid Analogies Research Group) explored symbolic analogies.

**SIL contribution:** Use **continuous geometric methods** instead of symbolic pattern-matching. This handles fuzzy/partial analogies and scales to millions of concepts.

---

## 8. Impact and Applications

### 8.1 Scientific Discovery

**Use case:** Systematically search for cross-domain analogies to accelerate hypothesis generation.

Example: A biologist studying protein folding could search for analogies in "thermodynamics," "information theory," "topology," discovering connections not apparent through literature search.

### 8.2 Education

**Use case:** Help students understand difficult concepts through analogy mapping.

Example: "Quantum tunneling" is hard. The system finds analogies to "wave interference," "barrier penetration," "exponential decay" with visualization of how concepts map.

### 8.3 Multi-Agent Reasoning (Layer 3)

**Use case:** Agents discover cross-domain solutions by analogy transport.

Example: Agent solving optimization problem in domain A queries for analogies in "physics," discovers simulated annealing (from thermodynamics), applies cooling schedule by analogy.

### 8.4 RAG Enhancement

**Use case:** Improve retrieval by analogy, not just keyword match.

Example: User asks about "memory management in operating systems." System retrieves documents about "garbage collection," "cache eviction," and by analogy, "resource allocation in ecology" (surprisingly relevant conceptual parallels).

## 10. Success Criteria

The research succeeds if:

1. **Rediscovery:** We can rediscover historically documented analogies (Schrödinger, Darwin's "tree of life," etc.)
2. **Novel discovery:** We find new cross-domain analogies validated by domain experts
3. **Dimensionality:** M_A is demonstrably lower-dimensional than M_E
4. **Stability:** Analogies are stable across embedding models (not artifacts)
5. **Utility:** Researchers find the system useful for hypothesis generation
6. **Provenance:** Every discovered analogy has traceable derivation

---

## 11. Conclusion

Analogy is not keyword matching or distributional similarity. It is **structure-preserving geometric transformation** across semantic manifolds.

By formalizing analogies as:
- **Parallel directional transformations** (vector parallelism)
- **Neighborhood-preserving mappings** (topological structure)
- **Domain-centroid transport** (systematic cross-domain reasoning)

...we can build computational systems that discover, validate, and generate analogies at scale.

This research sits at the intersection of:
- **Cognitive science** (how humans reason)
- **Geometry** (manifold structure)
- **Semantics** (meaning representation)
- **AI** (computational discovery)

It extends SIL's existing work on semantic manifold transport, semantic observability, and hierarchical agency. And it provides theoretical foundations for the next generation of **analogy-aware semantic infrastructure**.

The potential impact:
- **Scientific discovery:** Accelerate cross-domain hypothesis generation
- **Education:** Help learners build conceptual bridges
- **AI reasoning:** Enable multi-agent systems to transfer knowledge across domains
- **Creativity:** Computational support for analogical thinking

**This is rigorous, implementable, and revolutionary.**

The work ahead is methodical, long-term, and necessary. As semantic systems become central to knowledge work, they must move beyond retrieval and similarity. They must reason by **analogy**—the hallmark of human insight.
