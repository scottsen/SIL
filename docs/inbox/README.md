# SIL Documentation Inbox

**Purpose**: Staging area for extracted documents awaiting review, consolidation, and integration into the main SIL docs structure.

## Workflow

1. **Extract**: Documents extracted from conversations, sessions, or external sources land here
2. **Review**: Assess quality, relevance, overlap with existing docs
3. **Consolidate**: Merge, refine, or split as needed
4. **Compare**: Check against existing SIL docs for duplication or conflicts
5. **Integrate**: Move to proper location in `/docs/` hierarchy

## Organization

Documents are organized by extraction date or topic. Each document should include:
- Source (session ID, conversation, external link)
- Extraction date
- Intended destination (research/, articles/, foundations/, etc.)
- Status (raw, reviewed, ready-to-integrate)

## Index

<!-- Documents get listed here as they arrive -->
