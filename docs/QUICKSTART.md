# SIL Quickstart - 30 Minutes to Understanding

**Goal:** Understand what SIL is, try a production tool, and know where to go next.

**Total Time:** ~30 minutes (⏱️ time budgets shown for each section)

---

## ⏱️ 5 min: What is SIL?

**SIL (Semantic Infrastructure Lab)** builds the **Semantic Operating System** - infrastructure that makes AI reasoning transparent, traceable, and composable.

**The Core Problem:**
Most AI systems are powerful but structurally incomplete. They can generate text, but they can't show you *why*. They can't preserve meaning across transformations. They can't compose reliably across domains.

**SIL's Solution:**
A 6-layer architecture (like Linux for meaning) that provides:
- **Persistent semantic memory** (Layer 0) - Knowledge that survives beyond prompts
- **Universal intermediate representation** (Layer 1) - Cross-domain interoperability
- **Deterministic execution** (Layer 4) - Reproducible workflows
- **Transparent interfaces** (Layer 5) - Every reasoning step is visible

**Not research speculation - it's operational:** 11 projects, 5 in production, used daily.

**Key Innovation:**
**"Wood-to-steel moment"** - Just as steel transformed construction from improvisation to engineered infrastructure, SIL provides the semantic substrate to transform AI from clever heuristics to reliable systems.

## ⏱️ 10 min: Try Reveal (Production Code Exploration)

**Reveal** is SIL's first production tool - progressive code exploration that reduces AI agent token usage by 86%.

### Install (30 seconds):
```bash
pip install reveal-cli
```

### Try It (3 examples, ~9 minutes):

**Example 1: See file structure** (2 min)
```bash
# Instead of reading entire files, see structure first:
reveal your_code.py
```

**What you'll see:**
- Class definitions
- Function signatures
- Docstrings
- Dependencies

**Why this matters:** Agents can now understand code structure with ~50 tokens instead of 500+.

---

**Example 2: Extract specific functions** (2 min)
```bash
# Get just the function you need:
reveal your_code.py function_name
```

**What you'll see:**
- Full function implementation with line numbers
- Ready to paste into context

**Why this matters:** Precise extraction = no token waste on irrelevant code.

---

**Example 3: Agent-help standard** (5 min)
```bash
# See how tools should present themselves to agents:
reveal --agent-help

# Two-tier system:
# Tier 1: Quick reference (50 tokens)
# Tier 2: Full docs (500 tokens)
```

**Why this matters:** This is the pattern ALL tools should follow - progressive disclosure for agents.

---

### What You Just Learned:
✅ **Semantic infrastructure is practical** - Reveal is on PyPI, used in production
✅ **Progressive disclosure works** - Structure → Details → Full context
✅ **Token efficiency matters** - 86% reduction = $47K/year savings per 1000 agents

## ⏱️ 10 min: Read the Manifesto

**Why:** Understand SIL's philosophy, principles, and vision.

**Read:** [SIL Manifesto](canonical/SIL_MANIFESTO.md)

**Key sections to focus on:**
1. **§1: Making Meaning Visible** - What "manifesto" means here
2. **§2: Epistemic Commitments** - SIL's architectural principles
3. **§8: Cross-Domain Composition** - Why universal IR matters
4. **§11: Ecosystem** - 11 projects, what's operational now

**Pro tip:** Keep the [Glossary](canonical/SIL_GLOSSARY.md) open while reading technical terms.

**After reading, you'll understand:**
- Why semantic infrastructure is civilization-scale work
- How SIL differs from LangChain/AutoGPT (substrate vs framework)
- What "transparent reasoning" actually means
- Why Tia (the semantic agent) is named and visible
