# SIL Quickstart

**Get hands-on with Semantic Infrastructure Lab tools in 10 minutes**

> **Navigation:** This is the hands-on path.

## What You'll Learn

- Install and use production SIL tools (Reveal, TIA)
- Experience progressive disclosure firsthand
- Understand how semantic infrastructure works in practice

---

## 1. Install Reveal (2 minutes)

Reveal is SIL's semantic code exploration tool — experience progressive disclosure immediately:

```bash
# Install via pip
pip install reveal-cli

# Or via uvx (no install needed)
uvx reveal-cli
```

**Verify installation:**

```bash
reveal --version
```

---

## 2. Try Progressive Disclosure (5 minutes)

Progressive disclosure means seeing structure before detail. Let's explore code semantically:

```bash
# Use any project (or your own codebase)
cd /path/to/any/project  # or: git clone https://github.com/Semantic-Infrastructure-Lab/reveal

# Level 1: Directory structure
reveal src/

# Level 2: File structure (no code, just outline)
reveal src/main.py

# Level 3: Specific element (function, class)
reveal src/main.py function_name

# Level 4: Check code quality
reveal src/main.py --check
```

**What just happened?**
- You went from 0 → specific code without reading everything
- Token usage: ~50 tokens vs ~7,500 for full file
- Semantic structure revealed the path

## 3. Explore SIL Documentation (3 minutes)

Now that you've experienced progressive disclosure, understand the principles:

### The 30-Minute Path

1. **[Manifesto](canonical/SIL_MANIFESTO.md)** (15 min) — Why semantic infrastructure matters
2. **[Principles](canonical/SIL_PRINCIPLES.md)** (10 min) — The 14 principles that guide all work
3. **[START_HERE](canonical/START_HERE.md)** (5 min) — Navigate to deeper topics

### The Hands-On Path

1. **[Reveal Documentation](tools/REVEAL.md)** — Learn all reveal features
2. **[Agent Help Standard](research/AGENT_HELP_STANDARD.md)** — How to make tools agent-friendly
3. **[Progressive Disclosure Guide](canonical/PROGRESSIVE_DISCLOSURE_GUIDE.md)** — The theory behind what you just experienced

### The Technical Deep-Dive Path

## Core Idea in One Sentence

**SIL builds the semantic substrate that makes meaning explicit, memory stable, reasoning inspectable, and provenance traceable.**
