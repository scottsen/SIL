# SIL Implementation Roadmap - Q1 2026

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-20
**Architecture:** Provenance-First (v3.0, adopted Dec 20)
**Scope:** Q1 2026 tactical implementation (16 weeks)

**📍 SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** - For Q1 2026 implementation timelines, priorities, and milestones. Consolidated from 5 conflicting roadmaps (Dec 20, enchanted-goddess-1220).

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** Architecture finalized (Dec 20), Layer 1 at 30% complete (critical bottleneck)

**Critical Path:** Layer 1 primitives (Intent, Uncertainty, Operators) → Agent Ether enforcement → Full stack integration

**Timeline:** Q1 2026 (16 weeks) for Agent Ether Phase 1-3

**Decision Authority:** Scott Senkeresty (Founder)

---

## Layer Completion Status

**Methodology:** Two measures for each layer:
- **Code %** = Production implementation exists (tests passing, deployed)
- **Semantic %** = Tracks intent, uncertainty, contracts as required by Provenance-First model

| Layer | Name | Code % | Semantic % | Status | Bottleneck |
|-------|------|--------|------------|--------|------------|
| **0** | Provenance | 70% | 70% | 🟢 Production | Uncertainty metadata |
| **1** | Primitives | 30% | 30% | ⚠️ **CRITICAL** | Intent, Uncertainty, Operators |
| **2** | Structures | 60% | 60% | 🟡 Partial | Domain manifests |
| **3** | Composition | 70% | 70% | 🟢 Functional | TBC specification |
| **4** | Dynamics | 85% | 30% | 🟡 Mixed | Cryptographic derivation |
| **5** | Execution | 40% | 90% | 🟡 Mixed | Intent UI implementation |
| **6** | Reflection | 30% | 30% | 🟡 Design | Multi-agent protocol |

**Why two percentages?**
- **L4 Code=85%**: Morphogen v0.12.0 production (1,705 tests, 39 domains)
- **L4 Semantic=30%**: No cryptographic verification of derivations, no sensitivity analysis
- **L5 Code=40%**: Basic CLI exists but no intent lineage browser
- **L5 Semantic=90%**: Reveal, help://, 200+ commands operational

**Overall:** 55% code implementation, 56% semantic completeness

---

## Production Systems (Verified Dec 20)

✅ **GenesisGraph v0.3.0** - Cryptographic provenance (L0)
- 320 tests, 98% SD-JWT coverage
- Layer 0 (Provenance) enforcement

✅ **Reveal v0.25.0** - Progressive disclosure (L5, cross-cutting)
- 3K+ downloads/month on PyPI
- 86% token reduction proven
- Observability invariant enforcement

✅ **Beth** - Semantic search (L0, cross-cutting)
- 14,549 files indexed
- < 500ms search performance
- Efficiency invariant contribution

✅ **Morphogen v0.12.0** - Deterministic computation (L4)
- 1,705 tests passing
- 39 domains unified
- Grounded computation invariant (partial)

✅ **TIA Coordination** - Agent coordination (L3)
- ~3,000 lines lib/agent/
- Basic orchestration operational
- Missing: Contract enforcement

**Overall Invariant Enforcement:** 67% (3.5/5 production-ready)

| Invariant | Enforced By | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Everything has lineage | GenesisGraph v0.3.0 | ✅ Production |
| Reasoning is inspectable | Reveal v0.25.0 | ✅ Production |
| Computation is grounded | Morphogen v0.12.0 | 🟡 Prototype |
| Contracts are explicit | Agent Ether 0.1.0-alpha | 🔴 Spec only |
| Efficiency is sustainable | Beth + Reveal | ✅ Production |

**Critical Gap:** "Contracts are explicit" has NO enforcement mechanism (Agent Ether spec-only)

- Architect time: $12K (4 hours/week × 16 weeks × $200/hr)
- **Total: ~$60K for Q1 2026**

## Decision Points (Go/No-Go Gates)

### Week 2: Intent Primitives Review
**Question:** Is IntentSignature approach viable?
**Criteria:**
- Tests passing
- Performance acceptable (< 1ms overhead)
- Usable API

**If NO GO:** Revise approach, extend by 1 week

---

### Week 4: Uncertainty Tracking Review
**Question:** Can we track uncertainty without excessive overhead?
**Criteria:**
- Uncertainty gradient calculation < 10ms
- No memory leaks
- Usable for multi-step workflows

**If NO GO:** Simplify tracking, focus on critical paths only

---

### Week 8: Layer 1 Integration Review
**Question:** Are primitives sufficient to proceed with Agent Ether Phase 2?
**Criteria:**
- All 3 subsystems integrated
- End-to-end test passing
- No major bugs

**If NO GO:** Extend Track 1, delay Agent Ether Phase 2 start

---

### Week 12: Agent Ether Phase 2 Review
**Question:** Is static validation working as designed?
**Criteria:**
- Validator catches 90%+ type errors
- Contract library has 10+ standard contracts
- Composition primitives tested

**If NO GO:** Iterate on contract schema, extend Phase 2

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Specification Incomplete
**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** High (blocks implementation)
**Mitigation:**
- Weekly design reviews with Scott
- Iterate on spec during Phase 1
- Use governance specs (zifotike-1212) as guidance

---

### Risk 2: Performance Overhead Unacceptable
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** High (adoption resistance)
**Mitigation:**
- Static validation eliminates runtime checks where possible
- Profiling in Week 7-8 and Phase 3
- Target: < 5% overhead
- Fallback: Optional enforcement (dev vs production)

---

### Risk 3: Resource Constraints (No FTE Available)
**Likelihood:** High (unfunded)
**Impact:** Critical (roadmap blocked)
**Mitigation:**
- Track 1 can be done incrementally by Scott (4-6 hour sprints)
- Agent Ether Phase 1-2 requires dedicated engineer
- Seek funding or delay Agent Ether to Q2/Q3

---

### Risk 4: Adoption Resistance ("Too Much Ceremony")
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium (tools unused)
**Mitigation:**
- Make contract declaration ergonomic (good DSL)
- Provide templates for common patterns
- Show value: Multi-agent debugging becomes trivial
- Enforcement optional in dev, mandatory in production

---
