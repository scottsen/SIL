# Canonical Documents

**The foundational documents of the Semantic Infrastructure Lab**

These are the authoritative, definitive documents that define SIL's mission, principles, technical architecture, and governance.

## Core Foundation

### [Manifesto](SIL_MANIFESTO.md) ⭐ Start Here
**15 minutes** | Why semantic infrastructure matters

The problem with contemporary AI systems: they lack explicit meaning, stable memory, inspectable reasoning, and provenance. SIL exists to build this missing layer.

**This is the starting point** - understand the problem before exploring the solution.

---

### [Principles](SIL_PRINCIPLES.md)
**10 minutes** | The 14 principles that guide all SIL work

- 5 core principles (Clarity, Simplicity, Composability, Correctness, Verifiability)
- 9 operational principles (Structure before heuristics, Meaning must be explicit, Provenance everywhere, etc.)

These principles guide everything we build.

---

### [Glossary](SIL_GLOSSARY.md)
**Reference** | Canonical vocabulary (61 terms)

Precise definitions for all core concepts. **Keep this open while reading other documents.**

This is your reference guide - if you encounter an unfamiliar term, it's defined here.

---

### [Semantic OS Architecture](SIL_SEMANTIC_OS_ARCHITECTURE.md)
**30 minutes** | Six-layer technical architecture

Detailed explanation of the 6-layer Semantic Operating System:
- Layer 0: Semantic Memory
- Layer 1: Universal Intermediate Representation (USIR)
- Layer 2: Domain Modules
- Layer 3: Agent Orchestration
- Layer 4: Deterministic Computation Engines
- Layer 5: Semantic Interface Manager (SIM)

This is the technical foundation of everything SIL builds.

---

### [Stewardship Manifesto](SIL_STEWARDSHIP_MANIFESTO.md)
**20 minutes** | Values and governance

How SIL approaches stewardship, decision-making, and long-term sustainability.

**Core commitments:**
- Open research and transparent development
- Stewardship over ownership
- Long-term thinking
- Accountability to the community

---

### [Founder's Letter](FOUNDERS_LETTER.md)
**10 minutes** | Personal perspective

A personal introduction from the founder explaining why SIL exists, what gap it fills in modern AI infrastructure, and the commitment to explicit meaning and provenance.

This provides the human context behind the technical work.

---

## Research Contributions

These canonical documents present specific research contributions and theoretical frameworks emerging from SIL work.

### [Semantic Feedback Loops](SEMANTIC_FEEDBACK_LOOPS.md)
**40 minutes** | Closed-loop control for semantic systems

How semantic systems achieve precision through reflection-measurement-correction loops, analogous to op-amps in electronics. Establishes feedback loops as first-class primitives in semantic infrastructure.

---

### [Semantic Observability](SEMANTIC_OBSERVABILITY.md) ⭐ NEW
**45 minutes** | Automated intent-execution alignment detection

Framework for measuring semantic system health through vector embeddings, multi-dimensional fitness metrics, and automated classification of user signals. Enables continuous optimization without manual intervention.

**Key innovations:**
- Intent-execution mismatch as primary health signal
- Automated frustration/satisfaction classification via embeddings
- Multi-dimensional fitness: f(alignment, efficiency, satisfaction)

---

### [Multi-Agent Protocol Principles](MULTI_AGENT_PROTOCOL_PRINCIPLES.md)
**30 minutes** | Communication patterns for agent coordination

Principles for designing multi-agent communication protocols that enable composable, transparent agent collaboration.

---

### [Founder's Note: Multi-Shot Agent Learning](FOUNDERS_NOTE_MULTISHOT_AGENT_LEARNING.md)
**35 minutes** | Learning across agent interactions

How agents can learn and improve through multiple interaction cycles, building institutional memory.

---
