## 1. Purpose of the Technical Charter

This charter defines the formal structure, interfaces, constraints, and invariants of the Semantic Operating System (Semantic OS) developed by the Semantic Infrastructure Lab (SIL). It specifies what the system is, how components relate, what rules govern their interaction, and what guarantees they must uphold. This document is a specification of architectural foundations and system contracts. It is not an implementation guide and not a roadmap.

## 2. System Overview

The Semantic OS is a layered semantic substrate intended to support explicit meaning representation, provenance-complete transformation, deterministic workflow execution where feasible, and cross-domain interoperability.

The architecture consists of six layers:

Semantic Memory (Layer 0):
 Persistent storage of semantic objects, their schemas, temporal lineage, and provenance.

USIR (Layer 1):
 A typed, explicit, graph-structured intermediate representation for cross-domain semantic structures and transformations.

Domain Modules (Layer 2):
 Domain-specific schemas, invariants, operator families, and tool adapters integrated through USIR.

Orchestration (Layer 3):
 Deterministic workflow and agent execution semantics, including memory access protocols and provenance requirements.

Engines (Layer 4):
 Deterministic or bounded-reproducible execution of operators over USIR, including symbolic and numeric engines.

Interfaces / SIM (Layer 5):
 Human-facing inspection, visualization, debugging, and exploration surfaces for interacting with the substrate and its transformations.

## 3. Core Definitions

The following definitions apply throughout this charter.

Semantic object

A typed, addressable entity stored in Semantic Memory that represents a concept, relation, artifact, operator, workflow, derivation, state snapshot, or domain construct. Each semantic object conforms to a schema and is subject to integrity constraints.

Operator

A defined transformation with a typed signature, preconditions, postconditions, declared effects, and mandated provenance emission. Operators consume and produce semantic objects and/or USIR graphs.

Invariant

A declarative constraint that must hold over one or more semantic objects, USIR graphs, workflows, or domain structures. Invariants may be enforced by validation, checked by engines, or asserted with explicit status and scope.

Provenance record

A structured record describing the lineage of a semantic object or transformation, including the operator invoked, inputs, outputs, parameters, assumptions, execution context, state references, and validation outcomes.

Schema

A versioned specification defining the structure, typing, required fields, allowed relations, and integrity constraints of a semantic object class or USIR subgraph pattern.

Domain module

A bounded semantic package that defines a domain’s schemas, invariants, operator families, validation rules, and tool adapters, integrated into the Semantic OS via USIR contracts.

USIR node

A typed node in a USIR graph representing an entity such as a value, structure, operator application, constraint, workflow element, or domain construct.

USIR graph

A typed, explicit, directed multigraph composed of USIR nodes and typed relations. USIR graphs represent semantic structures, operator applications, workflows, and derivations.

Workflow

A structured representation of a task as an operator graph with execution semantics, dependencies, inputs/outputs, state requirements, and provenance obligations.

State snapshot

A versioned capture of relevant semantic memory and execution context sufficient to enable replay, validation, and inspection of a workflow or operator chain.

Engine

A computational component that executes operators over USIR under specified reproducibility contracts, emitting typed outputs and provenance records.

Agent

An entity executing workflows under orchestration rules, including explicit state transitions, constrained memory access, and mandatory provenance emission for actions.

Transformation

Any operator-driven change to semantic objects, USIR graphs, or workflows, including creation, mutation (where permitted), derivation, lowering, lifting, and composition.

Validity / consistency conditions

Formal checks that determine whether semantic objects, USIR graphs, workflows, and provenance satisfy schemas, typing rules, invariants, integrity constraints, and execution contracts.
